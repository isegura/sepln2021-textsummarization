Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.\"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"\n"," \"Maverick\" is a word that seems to follow Craig Venter around.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 1 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 0.5320390383402507  min ---  31.92234444618225  sec ---\n","Australia's foreign minister said these were \"not the actions of a friend\".The UK took similar action in March, after concluding that Israel was responsible for the use of forged UK passports in the plot.The Israeli foreign ministry said Australia's decision was disappointing.Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said it was \"not in line with the importance and the quality of the relationship between our countries\".At least four forged Australian passports were used in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January.

All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us.\"There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep.\"In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England.\"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest\".\"It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps. In his eyes, there was only defeat. He had lost an army.\"The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation.My father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a \"lack of moral fibre\".\"We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others.\"Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital.\"About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches.\"The captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain.\"We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return.\"To my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo.\"This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day,\" he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.\n"," BBC world affairs correspondent Peter Biles has been talking to his father, Harold, about his recollections of the Dunkirk evacuation.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 3 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 1.0485301693280538  min ---  62.91181254386902  sec ---\n","Comrade Akaash's statement comes after the rebels were blamed for Friday's train crash which left 148 people dead.Police say Maoist rebels sabotaged the track, causing the derailment of the Calcutta-Mumbai express in West Bengal.Maoists denied the charge.

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.'

She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book.

It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two.

were involved in the 7/7 bombings in London.She said she believed the intelligence on Iraq's threat was not \"substantial enough\" to justify the action.Baroness Manningham-Buller said she had advised officials a year before the war that the threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited\", and she believed that assessment had \"turned out to be the right judgement\".Describing the intelligence on Iraq's weapons threat as \"fragmentary\", she said: \"If you are going to go to war, you need to have a pretty high threshold to decide on that.\"In a previously secret document from 2002, Baroness Manningham-Buller wrote to the Home Office saying: \"We assess that Saddam is only likely to order terrorist attacks if he perceives that the survival of his regime is threatened.\"The Chilcot inquiry is continuing to hear evidence about decisions taken in the build-up to the invasion and its aftermath.Baroness Manningham-Buller, head of the domestic intelligence service between 2002 and 2007, said the terrorist threat to the UK from al-Qaeda and other groups \"pre-dated\" the Iraq invasion and also the 9/11 attacks in the US.However, she said the UK's participation in the March 2003 military action \"undoubtedly increased\" the level of terrorist threat.By Peter BilesBBC correspondent at the inquiryThe former head of MI5 chose her words very carefully.Baroness Manningham-Buller was giving her evidence in public, although 35 witnesses have previously testified to the Iraq inquiry behind closed doors in order to protect national security or international relations.Key to her evidence was the release of the declassified assessment which she wrote in March 2002, a year before the invasion of Iraq.This played down the direct threat to the UK from Saddam Hussein's regime, and its possible links to al-Qaeda.As was expected, the focus of her evidence remained on the implications of the 2003 invasion for Britain, rather than the actual decision to go to war.Given the gravity of the situation, with 16 suspected terrorism plots uncovered in the UK between 2001 and 2008, it may be a surprise to some that she did not have direct conversations with Tony Blair during her time as head of MI5.A year after the invasion, she said MI5 was \"swamped\" by leads about terrorist threats to the UK.\"Our involvement in Iraq, for want of a better word, radicalised a whole generation of young people, some of them British citizens who saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam,\" she said, before immediately correcting herself by adding \"not a whole generation, a few among a generation\".The ex-MI5 chief said she shared her concerns that the Iraq invasion would increase the UK's exposure to terrorism with the then home secretary David Blunkett, but did not \"recall\" discussing the matter with Prime Minister Tony Blair.MI5 did not \"foresee the degree to which British citizens would become involved\" in terrorist activity after 2004, she admitted.\"What Iraq did was produce fresh impetus on people prepared to engage in terrorism,\" she said, adding that she could produce evidence to back this up.\"The Iraq war heightened the extremist view that the West was trying to bring down Islam. We gave Bin Laden his jihad.\"Lady Manningham-Buller said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion.\"By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the prime minister for a doubling of our budget,\" she said. \"This is unheard of, certainly unheard of today, but he and the Treasury and the chancellor accepted that, because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem that we were confronted by.\"Baroness Manningham-Buller was part of the government's Joint Intelligence Committee before the war, which drew up the controversial dossier on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. The dossier stated the weapons could be activated with 45 minutes of an order to do so.Asked about the dossier, she said she had very limited involvement in its compilation but it was clear, with hindsight, that there was an \"over-reliance\" on certain intelligence.She added: \"We were asked to put in some low-grade, small intelligence into it and we refused because we did not think that it was reliable.\"She said MI5's responsibility was to collect and analyse intelligence and to \"act on it where necessary\" to mitigate terrorist threats, but stressed it was not her job \"to fill in gaps\" in the intelligence.A year before the war, the former MI5 chief advised Home Office officials that the direct threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited and containable\".In a newly declassified document, published by the inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller told the senior civil servant at the Home Office in March 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq had any involvement in the 9/11 attacks.While there were reports of links between the regime of Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, there was no intelligence to suggest meaningful co-operation between the two.In that letter, she said the possibility Iraq might use terrorist tactics to defend its own territory in the event of an invasion could not be ruled out.But she stressed Iraqi agents did not have \"much capability\" to carry out UK attacks, adding her view of this never changed.In his evidence in January, Tony Blair described Saddam Hussein as a \"monster\" and said the world was a safer place with him no longer in control of Iraq.\n"," The invasion of Iraq \"substantially\" increased the terrorist threat to the UK, the former head of MI5 has said.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 15 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 4.620276856422424  min ---  277.21661353111267  sec ---\n","The Gaia satellite will be sent far from Earth to map the positions of more than a billion stars in our galaxy.Remarkable sensitivity should also enable the observatory to see hundreds of thousands of new celestial objects, including previously unknown planets.The main structure of the spacecraft was moved this week from the UK factory where it has been for a year to undergo tests on its propulsion system.EADS Astrium in Stevenage transported Gaia by road to Ampac-ISP at Aylesbury for checks on its cold gas micro-thrusters.  Once this work is complete, the structure will then go to Astrium's Toulouse, France, facility for final preparations.The European Space Agency (Esa) satellite is due for launch in 2012 on a Soyuz rocket from the new Sinnamary spaceport in French Guiana.Gaia is a successor to Europe's Hipparcos space astrometry mission which ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  It catalogued more than 100,000 stars in our galaxy.The new mission is a step change in capability, however.

These details will unlock new information about the structure, origin and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy.And because Gaia will track anything that passes across its field of vision, it is likely also to see countless objects that had hitherto gone unrecorded - such as asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, and tepid stars that never quite fired into life.What you see in the image at the top of this page is Gaia's electrical and service module.This is the part of the satellite that will do all of the \"housekeeping\" in space.

And President Hu Jintao has said many times that peaceful development is a strategic choice of the Chinese government.Prof Geoff Wade, a historian who has translated Ming documents relating to Zheng's voyages, disputes the portrayal of a benign adventurer.He says the historical records show the treasure fleets carried sophisticated weaponry and participated in at least three major military actions; in Java, Sumatra and Sri Lanka.\"Because there is virtually no critical analysis of these texts even now - history writing is still in the hands of the state - it's very difficult for Chinese people to conceive of the state as being dangerous, expansionist, or offensive in any way to its neighbours.\"Chinese nationalism is fed on ignorance of its past relations. The way Zheng He is being represented is part of this.\"The International Zheng He Society in Singapore disputes this \"Western thought\", and says the battles that Zheng was embroiled in were either retaliatory or an effort to rid the high seas of pirates.\"These incidents were hardly the nature of true battle but, instead, vividly signify the peaceful diplomacy of Zheng He,\" said spokesman Chen Jian Chin.Many layers of myth surround China's ancient mariner.

According to Arnold Esguerra, a history professor at the University of the Philippines in Manila, the surname Ampatuan only started to appear in official documents in the early part of the 20th Century.At that stage they were influential traders, he said - but their social status was definitely beneath that of the \"datus\", the traditional clan rulers.The situation changed in the mid-1970s, when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, and tried to stamp out the growing Islamic separatist movement by selecting a few people he could trust to administer the province.One of those people was Andal Ampatuan Junior's father, Andal Senior, who is now the undisputed head of the family clan.First, he became the mayor of Maganoy town - and then, during the presidency of Cory Aquino, he was given the more powerful role of officer-in-charge.But it was under President Gloria Arroyo, who came to power in 2001, when the Ampatuans really came to prominence.Andal Senior became governor of Maguindanao, a post he has now held for the maximum three terms.  Then in 2005 his son Zaldy became the governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao - an influential post controlling the five Muslim provinces that have been given a degree of self-rule from central government.'Heights of power'Andal Junior became mayor of Datu Unsay, a town that bears his nickname, and at the time of the massacre, 10 of Maguindanao's 34 municipalities were run by Ampatuans or their relatives.Mrs Arroyo's government was good to the Ampatuans, providing funds for the region, and in the process propelling Andal Senior to \"undreamed-of heights of power\", according to a report by the International Crisis Group.In 2006, Mrs Arroyo issued an executive order legalising the informal private \"armies\" being kept by families like the Ampatuans, enabling them to work alongside the regular army - but by extension legitimising their use as a means of local control.In return the Ampatuans openly supported her in election campaigns.There are widespread claims that the family helped rig votes for Mrs Arroyo in the controversial 2004 election, which she narrowly won. Both the Ampatuans and the former president deny the allegations.At the time of the massacre, the clan had an estimated 28 mansions, scores of luxury cars, large amounts of rice-producing land and a heavily armed private army of more than 2,000 men.According to the International Crisis Group, the Ampatuans also controlled the police, the judiciary and the local election commission, and possessed mortars, rocket launchers and assault rifles.Even now, after the finger of blame has been pointed at them for the November massacre, the family still retains a lot of its influence. At least 15 Ampatuans won victories in May's election - some of whom have charges against them.And according to Jessica Evans from Human Rights Watch, Andal Senior is still able to give orders to his subordinates from inside jail.Of course none of this means the Ampatuans are necessarily guilty of the killings, or that all members of the clan act in a similar way.In fact, according to Amina Rasul, director of the Philippine Council on Islam and Democracy, some Ampatuans are very effective and popular community leaders.\"They're not all cut from the same cloth. Many are professional, and have real support,\" she said.But human rights groups are still concerned about the dominance of these family clans, and they warn that the influence and power exhibited by the Ampatuans is by no means unique.\"I don't think this is an isolated incident,\" said Amina Rasul. \"There are other families in other parts of the Philippines that are just as powerful.\"The Philippine military recently admitted that there were at least 112 private armies around the country - an indication, perhaps, of how many more clans and family groups hold sway over their own private fiefdoms.Whether by chance or design, presidential policies over the past few decades have given certain families the opportunity to amass extraordinary levels of power and influence.The first priority of the trial into last November's massacre is undoubtedly to bring justice for those who were so brutally killed.But human rights groups are hoping that the case will also persuade the current government, under President Benigno Aquino, to bring an end to the dominance of families like the Ampatuans.\n"," The main suspect in the most brutal massacre in recent Philippine history has gone on trial.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 26 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 8.064784276485444  min ---  483.8870587348938  sec ---\n","Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas.Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular.Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.(% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable)England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: \"Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate.\"School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.\"Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: \"Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged.\"From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat.\"School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.\"School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.More children in Scotland eat school lunches -

They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery.In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet.Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top.The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow.The team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin's performance.\"Javey's work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach.The heart of Professor Bao's devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group's skins with less layers.\"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News.\"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added.The overall flexibility of the Stanford group's skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group's approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed.Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high.Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques.John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials.\"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote.However, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel\", as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.\n"," \"Artificial skin\" that could bring a sensitive touch to robots and prosthetic limbs, has been shown off.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 31 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 9.509091405073802  min ---  570.5454862117767  sec ---\n","The TUC's annual gathering backed a motion which included calls to build \"a broad solidarity alliance of unions and communities under threat\".TUC chief Brendan Barber warned that big cuts would make Britain a \"dark, brutish and more frightening place\".The PM's spokesman said they wanted \"partnership\" with the unions to tackle the deficit.The opening of the TUC's 142nd congress - the first under a non-Labour government since 1996 - comes amid concern among unions about the speed and scope of the coalition's programme to reduce the £155bn deficit.Union voices: How to tackle cuts'Responsible' cuts battle urgedLabour can't be meek - HarmanSend us your viewsMost Whitehall departments have been ordered to plan for savings of between 25% and 40% ahead of the comprehensive spending review of 20 October.Delegates debated a motion calling for the TUC's general council to \"support and co-ordinate campaigning and joint union industrial action, nationally and locally, in opposition to attacks on jobs, pensions, pay or public services\".It could lead to different unions calling strikes on the same days if the cuts are not scaled back, although BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said trade union laws and union leaders' desire to build a wide coalition against the cuts made a \"winter of discontent\" unlikely.The motion rejected the idea that cuts were necessary to pay for the deficit and said they were a \"savage and opportunistic attack on public services\" which \"goes far further than even the dark days of Thatcher\".TUC general secretary Mr Barber told delegates: \"These are not temporary cuts, but a permanent rollback of public services and the welfare state. Not so much an economic necessity as a political project driven by an ideological clamour for a minimal state.\"What they take apart now could take generations to rebuild. Decent public services are the glue that holds a civilised society together and we diminish them at our peril.

He said the first co-ordinated action was not likely to take place until February or March 2011.By Ben WrightPolitical correspondent, BBC NewsMinisters have spent the summer softening the public up for cuts but, with big job losses looming, the unions haven't been persuaded.Brendan Barber called the government's assertions \"insulting claptrap\".Some trade union leaders, such as Bob Crow and Mark Serwotka, predict civil disobedience and coordinated strike action in response to cuts. But moderates like Mr Barber want to temper the tone and place the union movement at the centre of an alliance with the public, charities and community groups who oppose the cuts.So talk of a new winter of discontent may be wide of the mark, not least because secondary picketing is now illegal. But also because union leaders like Barber will be very wary about embarking on strike action that hits the users of public services hard and risks turning their members into villains.The government wants to sound moderate too, hence Francis Maude's insistence he wants to see engagement and \"partnership\" between the unions and ministers. But confrontation looks likely so long as there's a chasm between the Treasury and the unions on how to deal with the deficit.What is the Trades Union Congress?Only one delegate spoke against the motion, Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the airline pilots' union BALPA. He said it might be seen as an \"open goal\" for the government, and warned some union colleagues were \"getting the tone wrong\" in resisting every cut and they had to get the message out beyond unions to the wider community.Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' (RMT) leader Bob Crow has called for a campaign of \"civil disobedience\" but Mr Barber told the BBC he thought that was \"counter-productive\".Instead he said he favoured \"a broad-based campaign... to look to harness public opinion behind the case for a different approach to managing our economy.\"He spoke against a purely critical campaign, asking unions to promote an \"alternative to austerity that encourages growth and jobs\".Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude told the BBC: \"We will listen very carefully to what they [the unions] say and the arguments that they make, there's no question about that. We are not going back to the days where there's a complete stand-off between the trade unions and the government. Those days are gone.\"But he said the coalition government had \"inherited a terrible budget deficit\" and was having to borrow £1 out of every £4 \"just to keep the lights on\".He said it was \"absolutely necessary\" to eradicate the budget deficit - to stop interest rates going up and \"choking off\" the recovery.He said the government wanted to protect front-line services and jobs and had spent months renegotiating with the government's suppliers to cut costs, to try to protect as many jobs as possible.Downing Street also said the government wanted \"a genuine partnership with the trade unions\".The PM's spokesman said. \"We need to deal with the deficit, we want to work with everyone in tackling that.\"For all the rhetoric of the union leaders, the BBC's Political Editor Nick Robinson said it would be up to individual members whether to take strike action in ballots over the coming months.But he said there were growing indications of disquiet among council workers and police officers.Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison public services union, is calling for united action to defeat the government's \"austerity agenda\".A special BBC News season examining the approaching cuts to public sector spendingThe Spending Review: Making It ClearUnite, the UK's biggest union, says it wants a \"robust campaign\" to protect public services, while the GMB argues that three-quarters of a million jobs could be at risk.The RMT accuses ministers of launching \"all-out class warfare\".The government is not sending a minister to address the congress but Business Secretary Vince Cable has said he will be willing to speak to representatives to discuss their concerns.Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman addressed the TUC while the five candidates to become leader made their pitches to union delegates in the final hustings of the campaign.Each stressed their solidarity with the trade unions in the face of the anticipated spending squeeze but David Miliband said critics of the cuts needed to win the political arguments while brother Ed Miliband called for a \"responsible approach\" to opposition.The TUC congress is the curtain-raiser for the party conference season and will be followed over the next three weeks by events held by the Lib Dems, Labour and the Conservatives.\n"," Union delegates have backed joint industrial action if \"attacks\" on jobs, pensions and public services go ahead.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 32 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 9.925912646452586  min ---  595.5547609329224  sec ---\n","Mr Cowen had to deny being drunk or hungover during the RTE interview.The taoiseach was interviewed live from his party's conference, which is taking place in Galway.On Wednesday he said: \"I'm sorry that it emerged in the quality it did.

These different chemical signals are very very attractive to insects. And in the inital stages it's especially blowflies.\"\"So when someone dies, fairly soon, it could be within minutes blowflies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately. These will hatch into larvae or maggots and the developmental cycle will continue.\"\"You get a lot of male blowflies hanging around, sitting on plants around the body, waiting for suitable female mates.\"And it is this cycle of life and death that is critical in helping the police when they are uncertain of the timing of someone's death.By understanding the \"succession\" rates or the speed of growth of flies, from an egg to the larval then adult stage she and her colleagues can determine the likely time that person died.But scientists only have developmental data on perhaps half of the twelve or so species of fly that are regulary found on dead bodies.By breeding them in \"captivity\" under different temperature conditions they can get more accurate information about the timing of their growth and so the process of death.The accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been decomposing. If she can get to see a corpse within days of its death,  when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours.But, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days.This timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder.\"In some cases of assault, if someone has been seen leaving a pub after a fight say, then that person is found dead a few days later, if we can determine when they died to a matter of hours, we can help establish whether the person died from the assault or other causes.\"The time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February.One pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been \"mummified\".The critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C.This peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks.The man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck.The police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues' expertise.\"We can go two months with nothing but then be asked to help with six cases in a couple of weeks.\"\"It's rare that our evidence is used in court. It's more common that we give police a time window and they can then gather further evidence.\"Forensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. If a cadaver has been burnt this makes estimating time of death difficult for the pathologist.Between working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.There she compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the \"body farm\".In the summers of 2008 and 2009 she compared the decomposition of three pigs and three human cadavers.Her research isn't finalised but initial results are positive, confirming that pigs are a good model for how a human corpse decays.\"The same species of insects are attracted during the same time periods to both types of cadaver.  Large numbers of blowflies from days 1-5, fewer on days 6-7, and a large drop from day eight onwards,\" she told BBC News.She also says this research will be very useful for all cases where insect evidence is used.\"This work will have a big impact when it's published, for forensic entomologists all over the world.  As it will show that pigs are a good model for humans, and therefore all the data gathered using pig cadavers can be applied to cases involving human cadavers.\"Amoret Whitaker is just one of the scientists demonstrating their research at the one night only event \"After Hours: Science Uncovered\" at the Natural History Museum on Friday 24th September between 1600 and 2200\n"," At the top of a long staircase in a room in a tower, far away from the throng of visitors and other scientists and laboratories is the Natural History Museum's insectory.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 34 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 10.808462007840474  min ---  648.5077223777771  sec ---\n","The animals, which include a leopard, two lynx and two ring-tailed lemurs, were found at Borth Animalarium, near Aberystwyth.Owners Alan and Jean Mumbray admitted not having the correct paperwork for a commercial premises in court on Monday.They were both fined and told the animals would be found new homes.Jean Mumbray was fined £937.50 and ordered to pay costs of £250, and Alan Mumbray was fined £300 and £100 costs at Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court, said Dyfed-Powys Police.Sgt Ian Guildford, a wildlife and environmental police officer with the force, said: \"The use of the licensing system to control the sale and display of protected animals is a valuable tool in the fight against the trade in endangered animals.\"Anyone who is involved in dealing with protected animals on a commercial scale such as zoos and other similar establishments should be aware of this and make every effort to comply with the legislation.\"Without this, compliance loopholes are left open to those who treat endangered animals as a financial commodity.\"Nevin Hunter, of the Animal Health Wildlife Licensing and Registration Service, said the prosecution was \"very significant\" and showed that illegal use of endangered animals would not be tolerated.He added: \"The vast majority of zoos and animal parks in the UK do so lawfully and play an important part in conserving endangered species.\"However, those who choose to flout the regulations are on notice that we will take decisive action with police wildlife crime officers to ensure that prosecutions are taken forward.\"I commend Sgt Ian Guildford, Dyfed-Powys Police, and the Crown Prosecution Service for taking forward the case and achieving this outcome.\"\n"," Nine endangered animals are to be confiscated from a Ceredigion zoo after its owners admitted displaying animals without the proper paperwork.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 35 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 10.999750407536824  min ---  659.9850270748138  sec ---\n","Mutations of the NR5A1 gene were found in a small percentage of infertile men, reports the American Journal of Human Genetics.Scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London said it could help doctors investigating men with the condition.A UK expert said he hoped that further gene defects could be found.In the majority of cases, doctors can find no cause for male infertility, despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving.Male infertility appears to be more common within certain families, and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases, but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found.The latest research looks at a gene already known to be involved in sexual development in both men and women - defects in NR5A1 have been linked to physical defects in the development of the testicles or ovaries.Their findings suggest that, even where there is no physical evidence of a problem, defects in the gene may be hampering the ability to make sperm.They looked at the gene in 315 apparently healthy men who had an unexplained inability to produce sperm.From this group, they found mutations in the gene in just seven, and closer examination revealed the men had altered levels of sex hormones and, in one case, mild abnormalities in the cellular structure of the testicles.The research authors, from the UCL Institute of Child Health in London and the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said: \"We conclude that approximately 4% of men with otherwise unexplained failure to produce sperm carry mutations in the NR5A1 gene.\"Although the find would affect only a small proportion of infertile men, other specialists believe that other similar discoveries could help build up a clearer picture of the origins of the condition.Dr Allan Pacey, a senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield, said that there was still \"embarrassingly little\" known about the genetics behind male infertility.\"Given the complexity of the sperm production process it is likely that many genes are involved and therefore that may gene defects linked to infertility may be found.\"Although this gene defect affects only a small number of men, we need more studies like this so that we can fill in the gaps in our knowledge and possibly one day build a robust diagnostic test for male fertility based on genetics.\"\n"," A faulty gene could help explain some cases of unexplained male infertility, according to research.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 36 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 11.209786816438038  min ---  672.5872106552124  sec ---\n","Staff at Breckland Council will not be paid in future for the time they take to have a cigarette after the proposals were given the go-ahead.Simon Clark, from Smokers' lobby group Forest, said earlier that everyone was entitled to a break during work.The council said the move was aimed at making the issue of smoke breaks fairer for individuals who did not smoke.William Nunn, leader of the Conservative-run council, said: \"We are not trying to stop smoking... what we are saying is when people go for a cigarette they should do it in their own time.\"Mr Clark said: \"Are they going to introduce clocking in and off for people who go on the internet, on Facebook, or people who want to have a cup of coffee?\"I am sure there are some smokers who abuse the situation and go out too often but if that is happening that is a failure of management.\"A meeting of the full council voted to approve the measure on Wednesday.\n"," Proposals to make workers clock off when they go for a cigarette break have been backed by a Norfolk council.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 37 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 11.362515060106913  min ---  681.7509052753448  sec ---\n","The cash comes from chip maker Marvell which became a supporter and sponsor of OLPC in early 2009.The OLPC organisation said the grant meant it had all the development cash it needed to produce its next machine.OLPC said it would show off the first development work on the new machine at the CES show in January 2011.The cash handed over by Marvell will fund development of a tablet version of the XO -

Some argue that people can quickly sink into a cycle of debt, with many lenders charging exorbitant rates of interest.Dr Qazi Kholikuzzaman Ahmad, chairman of PKSF, a body that monitors microfinance, describes microcredit as a \"death trap\" for the poor.He explains how poor people often take up the loans without thinking of the consequences, and that 60% of borrowers take loans from several sources.\"There is no understanding that it might take 10 or 20 years to repay their loan,\" he says.Furthermore, from the weekly repayments, some lenders deduct 10% of that payment for compulsory saving schemes - money the company then uses to lend to other people.\"Interest on repayments begin at around 15%, but it is a flat rate and can soon rise to anything between 40% and 100%,\" Dr Ahmad says.Repayments are generally due on loans from the first week after they are taken out, which does not give the borrower enough time to establish any form of income-earning enterprise.To cover those first payments, people often resort to taking out a further loan from a different company.Ms Rani used her loan to buy six cows but after her crops were destroyed she had to sell three of them, at half the market price, to enable her to repay her loan.\"I was hoping to save the remaining cows but they had to be sold as well,\" she laments.Women are the main borrowers in the village and they were attracted to microcredit because they could get the loans easily and quickly.Money is not always used as capital investment. Many people borrow money for cultivation, buying cattle, or a flock of chicks or ducklings.Villagers are sending their children to work to help them make the repayments.Source: Microfinance Information Exchange 2009But when they are still unable to pay enough, the debt collectors insist that they sell their cattle, chickens and other household items.Selling agricultural land is also considered as a last desperate option.Villagers complain of harassment from the debt collectors and there have been allegations of physical assaults.Because field officers are judged on repayment rates, they sometimes use coercive and even violent tactics to collect instalments on the microcredit loans.Many villagers finally turn to local usurers - the very people whom Professor Yunus tried put out of business when he made his first loan of $27 (Â£17) to a group of families in a village in 1976.Professor Yunus and his Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance and he refers to many of the institutions which have followed his example as \"the new loan sharks.\"His organisation has a policy whereby loans are rescheduled in times of natural disaster.Relief costsAfter the floods in Bangladesh, the district administrations requested microfinance organisations to stop collecting instalments for the time being.But that call has gone unheeded.Dr Ahmad is dismayed.\"There are some agencies which even take their payments from relief material,\" he says.\n"," Joba Rani was a solvent farmer in the north east village of Jamlabaj, but her world turned upside down when early floods swamped her land in April.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 45 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 12.950598621368409  min ---  777.0359196662903  sec ---\n","They found that targeting a part of the brain called the parietal lobe improved the ability of volunteers to solve numerical problems.They hope the discovery could help people with dyscalculia, who may struggle with numbers.Another expert said effects on other brain functions would need checking.The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology.Some studies have suggested that up to one in five people have trouble with maths, affecting not just their ability to complete problems but also to manage everyday activities such as telling the time and managing money.Neuroscientists believe that activity within the parietal lobe plays a crucial role in this ability, or the lack of it.When magnetic fields were used in earlier research to disrupt electrical activity in this part of the brain, previously numerate volunteers temporarily developed discalculia, finding it much harder to solve maths problems.The latest research goes a step further, using a one milliamp current to stimulate the parietal lobe of a small number of students.The current could not be felt, and had no measurable effect on other brain functions.As it was turned on, the volunteers tried to learn a puzzle which involved substituting numbers for symbols.Those given the current from right to left across the parietal lobe did significantly better when given, compared to those who were given no electrical stimulation.The direction of the current was important - those given stimulation running in the opposite direction, left to right, did markedly worse at these puzzles than those given no current, with their ability matching that of an average six-year-old.The effects were not short-lived, either. When the volunteers whose performance improved was re-tested six months later, the benefits appear to have persisted.There was no wider effect on general maths ability in either group, just on the ability to complete the puzzles learned as the current was applied.Dr Cohen Kadosh, who led the study, said: \"We are not advising people to go around giving themselves electric shocks, but we are extremely excited by the potential of our findings and are now looking into the underlying brain changes.\"We've shown before that we can induce dyscalculia, and now it seems we might be able to make someone better at maths, so we really want to see if we can help people with dyscalculia.By Fergus WalshMedical correspondent, BBC NewsRead more in Fergus's blog\"Electrical stimulation is unlikely to turn you into the next Einstein, but if we're lucky it might be able to help some people to cope better with maths.\"Dr Christopher Chambers, from the School of Psychology at Cardiff University, said that the results were \"intriguing\", and offered the prospect not just of improving numerical skills, but having an impact on a wider range of conditions.He said: \"The ability to tweak activity in parts of the brain, turning it slightly 'up' or 'down' at will, opens the door to treating a range of psychiatric and neurological problems, like compulsive gambling or visual impairments following stroke.\"However, he said that the study did not prove that the learning of maths skills was improved, just that the volunteers were better at linking arbitrary numbers and symbols, and he warned that researchers needed to make sure other parts of the brain were unaffected.\"This is still an exciting new piece of research, but if we don't know how selective the effects of brain stimulation are then we don't know what other brain systems could also be affected, either positively or negatively.\"Sue Flohr, from the British Dyslexia Association, which also provides support for people with dyscalculia, said the research was welcome.She said: \"It's certainly an under-recognised condition, but it can ruin lives.\"It makes it very hard to do everyday things like shopping or budgeting - you can go into a shop and find you've spent your month's money without realising it.\"\n"," Applying a tiny electrical current to the brain could make you better at learning maths, according to Oxford University scientists.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 46 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 13.35825473467509  min ---  801.4952862262726  sec ---\n","Fifty-nine people had died up until and including Thursday, and 617 others had been infected, bringing the total affected to 7,359, the ministry added.The news came as the local authorities and relief agencies attempted to get clean drinking water to those areas worse affected by Hurricane Tomas.The storm caused flooding and left eight people dead in western Haiti.The charity, Save the Children, said that in Leogane, the streets had been turned into \"rivers\" and some 35,000 people had been affected.By Laura TrevelyanBBC News, LeoganeThe UN estimates 15,000 people in Leogane have been affected by the floods.Amercie lost her home when January's earthquake flattened this small town west of Port Au Prince.

It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA).The National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous.STATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power.The bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents.Mr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles.However, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power.Mr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections.IRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr.It brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion.Jaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued.A senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi.The Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region.The Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West.The two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats.The Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction.This alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern.It is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran.The alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform.While all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of ''national unity'', al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals.This group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha.Unity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki.Like al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links.The Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai.It consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level.Tribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006.While the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs.Smaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.BBC Monitoring selects and translates news from radio, television, press, news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.

But if we forget that the town's name comes from Beddau, the Welsh for graves, then we'd be losing an understanding of its possible roots as an ancient, pre-Christian burial site.\"But whilst the true meaning of Beddau's name is not fully understood, many other historical, socio-economic, and environmental riddles have been solved through the study of how our ancestors named their lands.Through the name of Dôl-y-Pennau in Snowdonia ( which translates into \"Meadow of Heads\"), members of the Llên Natur project were able to point archaeologists to the previously-undiscovered site of a massacre between feuding Welsh princes, which resulted in dozens of people being beheaded before their heads were discarded in a field in the area named in their memory.A study of a concentration in eastern Wales, of places bearing the suffix 'Wern' or 'Gwern' has similarly lent fresh understanding to the trade links between medieval Wales and the Norman Marcher states.Gwern derives from the Welsh for alder tree, the willow-like wood from which was used to manufacture clogs for agricultural workers.While the trees are native throughout Wales, the frequency of Wern and Gwern in the east of the country pointed historians towards studying potential sites where they may have been grown on a commercial basis, for sale to agricultural areas over the border in Herefordshire and Shropshire.But not all the discoveries are of a purely historical nature.The pine marten, a small mammal once native to Wales, is now facing extinction.However, the number of places which include 'bela' - Welsh for pine marten - in their name is testament to the frequency with which they were once found here.Conservationists are using these places as a starting point to study satellite imagery for potential sites where pine martens may one day be re-introduced into the wild.This weekend's conference is the culmination of years of work by Duncan Brown, a Welsh-speaker whose work for the Countryside Council for Wales led to his fascination with the links between  language and environment.But he warned: \"It's sometimes dangerous to read too much into place names, or to take them too literally.\"\"For example, places with 'eos' suffixes derive from the Welsh for nightingale.  They're no longer native to Wales, and there's some debate whether they ever were.\"Yet there are two clusters of 'eos' names in Wales, one around Carmarthenshire and Glamorganshire, and another in the north, centred around Denbighshire  and northern Powys.\"\"The south Wales group are prefixed with terms like 'llwyn', a copse, or 'y-pant' , a hollow, which correspond with the natural habitat of nightingales.\"\"However, the group in the north have prefixes like 'llety'r', from the Welsh for a tavern or inn.\"So the reference to nightingale is far more likely to have originated from someone who sung there, with the voice of a nightingale.\"Message of importanceThe Llên Natur conference is being opened with an address by Culture Minister Alun Ffred Jones.Mr Brown is hoping this will prove indicative of more concrete support for the project.\"It's fantastic to have Alun Ffred along to speak anyway, as it's a real recognition of the hard work everyone has put in,\" he said.\"Everyone knows that there's not much money to go around at the moment, but inexpensive things could make a big difference.\"\"We've already made a huge start on a database of place-names and their origins on the Llên Natur website, and with access to support from the assembly (government) we could go even further.\"\"Also, some within the group would like to see legislation brought before the assembly to prevent historic Welsh place names becoming anglicised or changed altogether to ones with no local significance.\"\"Even if the resources weren't available to police it rigorously, the simple presence of legislation would send out a message of the importance that Welsh place names continue to have to this day.\"\n"," Ask anyone from outside Wales to name something for which we're famous, and the odds are that the name of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch on Anglesey would rank in their top five.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 51 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 15.495355161031087  min ---  929.7213113307953  sec ---\n","The 80ft (24.3m) structure will be located on a raised part of the seafront in Redcar, at the site of the former Leos night club.It will have a viewing platform, a studio, galleries and a cafe.Work is due to start on the town's sea defences in early 2011, and the construction of the vertical pier is set to begin in the autumn.Councillor Sheelagh Clarke, cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism, said: \"The public told us that they wanted to see unique attractions in Redcar that do not replicate those of other resorts.\"The vertical pier will create a point of interest to attract people to Redcar and re-ignite interest in the town as a place to visit.\"\n"," Plans for a vertical pier in a Teesside coastal town have been given the go-ahead by council planners.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 52 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 15.638444769382478  min ---  938.3066885471344  sec ---\n","More than 100 people are still missing and feared dead after a hillside collapsed on Sunday, following the heaviest rains in the country for decades.Local residents initially used their bare hands to dig into tonnes of mud that engulfed some 30 houses.

More than 20 sniffer dogs have also been brought in.However, teams are moving cautiously for fear that heavy machinery will crush homes buried in the mud.Red Cross officials say that 174 people have died as a result of the heavy rains in Colombia, 225 have been injured and 19 are missing, without counting the victims of the Bello landslide.Tens of thousands have been left homeless after most major rivers have burst their banks as a result of the heavy rain.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has announced he is flying to Bello to personally assess the situation there.Mr Santos has said recovering from the torrential rains and the damage they have caused is going to be very expensive, and that he is considering calling a national state of emergency if the rains continue.\"Unfortunately, this tragedy has just kept growing,\" he said.Neighbouring Venezuela is also experiencing heavy flooding.Some 70,000 people have been driven from their homes there.President Hugo Chavez has said his government plans to seize private land to house some of those forced to abandon their homes.The May-November rainy season in Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America has been severe this year.The extreme weather is attributed to the La Nina climatic phenomenon, which is caused by colder than usual water currents along the Pacific coast.\n"," Rescuers say they have recovered 24 bodies following a landslide near the Colombian city of Medellin.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 53 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 15.897432553768159  min ---  953.8459558486938  sec ---\n","Scientists agree that such attacks are extremely rare - and that sharks are not the man-eaters depicted in Hollywood blockbusters such as Jaws.But they will try to determine why the sharks were lured into shallow waters, and what prompted them to carry out a series of attacks that left one person dead and several more injured.So far, two sharks - an oceanic white tip and a mako shark - have been caught by local fishermen, but experts say there is no evidence so far that either of them are responsible for the attacks.There is an abundance of oceanic white tip sharks - Carcharhinus longimanus - in the Red Sea. Divers have spoken of diving with oceanic white tips without feeling threatened.Sources: International Union for Conservation of Nature and International Shark Attack FilesBut Ian Fergusson, a shark biologist and patron of the Shark Trust, a UK conservation organisation, said the presence of the short-fin mako shark was intriguing.Oceanic white tips frequent the region but it was unusual for swimmers to encounter them in shallow waters, he said, and it was very rare for shortfin makos to be found in the Red Sea - and exceptionally rare to find them close to shore.He said the last time a short-fin mako attacked in the area was in 1970s, when a tourist was wounded in an attack off Eilat's reefs.Mr Fergusson, a regular visitor to the area, said it would not be difficult for a shark to get close to the shore in Sharm el-Sheikh.\"That particular part of the coastline is bordering on deep water. You don't have to go far offshore to find yourself in 500 metres of water. Sharks can get within half a mile of the shore easily. They don't, for example, have to cross reefs to get there.\"According to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack Files, there are an estimated 70-100 shark attacks on humans per year, resulting in about five to 15 deaths. Of those, the oceanic white tip is responsible for only a small number.But the large oceanic sharks were also the main culprits behind countless attacks on sailors and airmen who, after air and sea battles, found themselves adrift in the Pacific during World War II.So what could have prompted the latest attacks?There has been speculation that animal carcasses were recently dumped into the Red Sea, not far off the shore. Some reports have suggested the remains could have been thrown overboard by a ship carrying animal cargo.\"If you start dumping carcasses, you couldn't ask for a better way of baiting for sharks,\" said Mr Fergusson.David Jacoby, who specialises in shark behavioural ecology at The Marine Biological Association of the UK, agreed that if this is the case, it was likely to be a significant factor in the sharks' behaviour.\"Pelagic, or oceanic, species of shark often feed opportunistically because the open ocean can be a sparse environment for food,\" he said.While less is known about the movements and behaviour of the oceanic white tip, compared with some other species, Mr Jacoby offered another possible explanation as to why the sharks might have been in shallow water.Based on evidence, experts know that in other shark species, larger females move into warmer, shallow waters to either aid gestation - which can be between 9-12 months in white tips depending on the temperature - or to pup, although from what little evidence there is, it seems that oceanic white tips probably pup in the early summer.\"Both species [white tips and makos] rarely encounter people as they spend large amounts of their time in blue water - open ocean,\" said Mr Jacoby.\"Like other species, the oceanic white tip is opportunistic and can be fairly aggressive. It is hard to speculate why they attack but they might if they felt they were threatened.\"They are not coming specifically to attack humans - they are not seen as a food source. But if a white tip or mako felt threatened, felt cornered by lots of people in the water, or next to a reef, for example, it might display more aggressive behaviour as a defence mechanism.\"They are opportunistic and it could just be a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"Or, he said, they could be cases of mistaken identity - the shark misinterpreting a human for its normal prey.Mr Jacoby said shiny objects in the water could attract attention from sharks - so if the sharks were already in the area, shiny jewellery might be a trigger.There has also been speculation that sharks could have have moved to shallow water because of the depletion of local food sources in the area, but Mr Jacoby disagrees with this.\"This would surely have the opposite effect,\" he said.He explains that sharks adopt search behaviour aiming to maximise their encounters with food sources. Therefore, there is likely to be a relationship between natural prey distributions - fish, squid etc - and shark distributions, as the sharks generally try and go where the food is.However, if a potential food source such as carcasses have been discarded close to shore, some sharks would naturally pick up on this and opportunistically feed there. This would increase the numbers of sharks in the area, making interactions with people more likely.In the past, shark attacks on snorkellers have been blamed on shoddy diving practices such as \"chumming\" - attracting sharks by throwing solid bait or pouring chum, a mash of fish oil and blood, into the water.This type of activity aims to attract sharks such as oceanic white tips, which tend to stay out in the ocean.But Mr Fergusson said he didn't \"buy\" this theory.\"Recent studies in South Africa have shown that chumming has limited effect on shark behaviour.\"This is partly because these sharks are such migratory species, and mainly because this is a Marine National Park, any feeding is prohibited - anyone found doing it would be arrested and jailed.\"He said a more compelling argument could be a continued decline in pelagic fish stocks having an impact on the natural foraging behaviour of certain shark species.While any degradation to the ecosystem of the local reef wouldn't necessarily affect the oceanic white tip because this is outside of its natural habitat, Mr Fergusson said this could \"point to a larger issue of general offshore fishing of tuna and other big fish whittling down and influencing the food chain\".In Egypt, the hunt is still on for the shark that carried out the latest, fatal attack.Mark Murphy, who runs a scuba diving holiday firm in London, told the BBC that the local authorities would probably aim to have a \"quick clean-up of the area\".\"There are over four million visitors a year to the Red Sea and there hasn't been a single incident within the last five years,\" said Mr Murphy.\"I am saddened that the Egyptian government has decided to slaughter sharks indiscriminately. Over 70 million sharks a year are killed by humans and they are an essential part of the marine ecosystem.\"In any case, according to US-based shark expert Samuel Gruber, finding the predator or predators would be extremely difficult.\n"," International shark experts are arriving in Egypt to help investigate the attacks off the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh that have baffled local officials.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 54 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 16.330080556869508  min ---  979.8048355579376  sec ---\n","Figures from the Association of Public Health Observatories reveal the UK is the fattest EU member and has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancies.The UK also performs badly on female cancer survival and infant deaths.But life expectancy figures in the UK are slightly better than for EU counterparts and the nation also excels at treating heart disease.And our early action on smoking has had a very positive impact on health outcomes, the report authors say.They compared all regions across 27 countries in Europe using 37 health indicators in 2006.The UK as a whole scored particularly badly on obesity, being the fattest nation of all.And within the UK it was the West Midlands that had the highest percentage of obese adults at 29% - double the EU average of 14% and much higher than the 19% rate seen in Greater London.The UK's female death rates from cancer were also among the worst in Europe.Deaths in south-east England were the highest at 185 per 100,000, followed by Scotland at 179 per 100,000 and north-east England at 174.

sunlight.The nutrient keeps bones strong, and protects against conditions like osteoporosis.The guidance was drawn up because it is thought fears about skin cancer have made people too cautious about being in the sun.Cancer Research UK and the National Osteoporosis Society are among the bodies which agree that \"little and frequent\" spells in summer sunshine several times a week can benefit your health.The experts now say it is fine to go outside in strong sun in the middle of the day, as long as you cover up or apply sunscreen before your skin goes red.Professor Rona Mackie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: \"Total sun protection with high factor suncream on all the time is not ideal, in terms of vitamin D levels.\"Even Australia has changed its policy on this. They're now producing charts showing parts of Australia where sun protection may not be required during some parts of the year.\"Some of the messages about sun exposure have been too negative. UK summer sunshine isn't desperately strong. We don't have many days in the year when it is very intense.\"What's changed is that we're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.\"Official government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five.But the experts who wrote the joint statement say mothers often are not made aware of this recommendation. They suggest women consult their GP.Winter levels of vitamin D can be helped by a break in the tropical sun - or by eating oily fish, liver and fortified margarine.Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, Professor Peter Johnson, said: \"A good diet and sensible sun exposure will be adequate for the great majority of the UK population to minimise their cancer risk.\"The area of vitamin D and cancer is complex.\"There's some evidence, which is strongest in bowel cancer, that low levels of vitamin D in the blood correlate with the risk of developing cancer.\"But that doesn't mean those low levels cause bowel cancer.\"We think overall that low levels of vitamin D are unlikely to be major contributors to the chances of developing cancer in the UK population.\"The joint statement also highlighted questions about vitamin D that warrant further research.These include finding out the optimal levels of vitamin D, and more detail about the role of dietary sources and supplements.\n"," New health advice recommends short spells in the sun - without suncream and in the middle of the day.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 58 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 17.311610356966654  min ---  1038.6966235637665  sec ---\n","The ad - part of a government-funded anti violence campaign - holds a special significance at the time when many worry that an overflow of Mexico's drug violence could soon hit this small Central American nation.The first one to raise the alert was President Mauricio Funes himself, last April.\"We have information that they [the cartels] have entered El Salvador with exploratory purposes,\" President Funes said.Because of what he described as the \"effectiveness\" of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's policies, the cartels were looking at new bases for their operations, he added.Since then, security forces have been watching closely to see if criminal organisations like the Zetas - one of Mexico's most violent cartels - are deploying in Salvadorean territory.The cartels' possible collusion - or confrontation - with local gangs is also being monitored.Douglas Garcia Funes from the Salvadorean national police says intelligence suggests that gang members are already \"being used by or are operatives for the transport of drugs and money towards the United States, passing through Mexico\".In a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, this is a sobering scenario.It could bring more chaos to an already violent country, many Salvadoreans say - and the government seems to be bracing for the worst.\"We are certainly worried, and that is why we want to act in a preventive manner,\" Hugo Martinez, El Salvador's foreign minister, told BBC News.In pictures: Life inside an El Salvador jailThe presence of the gangs known as \"maras\", born among Salvadorean migrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s, is believed to be the largest contributor to those soaring rates.Some estimates say that about 15,000 young men and women belong to one of the gangs. In some families, a third generation of gang members is now developing.The maras have strong territorial control in some areas of the country and practice what they call \"social cleansing\" - they wipe out petty crime, but ask for money from locals in exchange for protection, and engage in widespread criminal activity.A retired gang member, who prefers not to be named, says that belonging to a \"mara\" gives young, poor Salvadoreans a sense of vindication against the larger society.\"People are scared, are afraid of what a gang member can do, like stealing or killing,\" he says.\"That is what being part of a 'mara' is about.\"The maras are not new to El Salvador, but an incident in June marked a turning point.Gang members set fire to a small bus in the capital, killing 17 people. The government branded it a \"terrorist act\".Soon afterwards, the government proposed a tough \"anti-mara\" bill that makes it a criminal offence to belong to a gang or contribute to gang finances by paying extortion fees.In addition, more than 6,000 soldiers - almost half of the army's manpower - have been deployed in hotspots around the country including border crossings, jails and areas with a strong \"mara\" presence.This tougher stance was seen by many as preparation for the threat of Mexican cartels moving in to El Salvador.The person who knows most about violence in El Salvador may well be Israel Ticas, a forensic investigator from the security ministry.He is the sole official in charge of the exhumation of bodies buried in clandestine graveyards by the gangs.He has already unearthed more than 38 of these graves around the country - and he believes there are dozens more still to be found.The walls of his office in the capital are covered with pictures of the bodies, many of them too hard to digest for a casual observer.They show men and women tortured, beheaded, mutilated; the violence seems to reach unimaginable levels.And, says Mr Ticas, the cruelty is only getting worse.\"In the last few years, the gangs have become more sophisticated\" in the way they bury their victims, he says.\"They hide [the bodies] better and it is harder for us to find them - now they leave a beheaded body in one site and the head is buried five kilometres [three miles] away.\"It is hard to imagine how violence in El Salvador could go any further - and that is why many fear that the arrival of foreign organised criminal groups would be a nightmare come true.\n"," From a giant billboard in the Salvadorean capital, a man with a defiant attitude shows off a slogan on his shirt: \"No one can intimidate El Salvador,\" it reads.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 59 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 17.633974730968475  min ---  1058.0384860038757  sec ---\n","The blast in a town in Puebla state was apparently caused by thieves attempting to steal fuel from the pipeline.Oil gushed through the streets and caught fire, destroying homes and cars and forcing hundreds of people to flee.Mexican President Felipe Calderon has visited the scene and promised to launch an investigation.Puebla State Secretary Valentin Meneses said the explosion injured 52 people as well as destroying 32 houses and damaging scores more in San Martin Texmelucan - a small community about 80km (50 miles) east of Mexico City.He said that according to early indications, a criminal gang had punctured the pipeline.\"They lost control because of the high pressure with which the fuel exits the pipeline.

He despatched troops to Angola and Ethiopia in support of fellow revolutionaries. His hand was seen in many a revolutionary movement in his own continent.But he has also been condemned for intolerance, for keeping his people poor and for refusing to see the benefits of economic liberalisation that even the communists of China have embraced.Fidel Castro stopped his people from leaving the island, leading them to risk their lives in rickety boats to try to get out.At one stage in the early years of the Reagan administration he was accused of trying to take over Central America for the Soviet Union by revolution.Washington at that time saw a path that led from the guerrillas of El Salvador through Nicaragua to Cuba and right up to the door of the Kremlin.Cuban assistance to the small and then revolutionary island of Grenada in the Caribbean prompted a full-scale US invasion.Throughout his rule, President Castro remained in almost permanent confrontation with the United States - and it with him.The American embargo on Cuba has been used by both sides - as a policy by the US to isolate Cuba and as an excuse by Fidel Castro for the island's poverty.US President Barack Obama and Castro's successor as president, younger brother Raul, announced a thawing in relations in 2015 but the embargo remains in place.When Mr Obama visited earlier this year - the first by a US leader in more than half a century - Castro remained defiant, saying Cuba did not need any gifts from the \"empire\" in a damning letter.He cut a giant figure on the world stage during the 47 years he controlled Cuba - at one point bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war.It was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that propelled him into worldwide prominence.Before that he had been just a glamorous revolutionary leader. He had overthrown the dictator Batista in a classic guerrilla war and had fought off an American-led invasion by Cuban exiles on the Bay of Pigs in 1961.But when Nikita Khrushchev decided, with Fidel Castro's agreement, to station nuclear missiles in Cuba itself, the island leader turned from being a thorn in the side of the Americans into being a mortal threat.It was only the skilled diplomacy of Jack Kennedy (and of Khrushchev in the end) that saved the day, and Fidel's own island from destruction.The then-US defence Secretary Robert McNamara met President Castro in 1992. He said the Cuban leader told him there were 162 nuclear missiles in Cuba at the time of the crisis.He asked Castro if he had recommended they be used. The answer was:\"Yes, I did.\"\"And what would have happened to Cuba?\" Mr McNamara asked him.\"It would have been destroyed.\"Fidel Castro was not part of the diplomacy that ended the missile crisis.But he came out of the crisis remarkably strengthened. Kennedy promised that the US would not invade Cuba, a promise that has held.The CIA made efforts to get rid of him with bizarre plots involving the Mafia and poison. They came to nothing. President Castro's people took immense precautions to protect him from potential harm from food and drink, as diplomats who invite him to their receptions in Havana found out.He survived harm from his enemies.And whatever happens to Cuba after him, the name of Fidel will survive in history.\n"," He is instantly recognisable both from his appearance - the beard and the military fatigues - and from his first name alone: Fidel.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 68 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 20.247945431868235  min ---  1214.8767280578613  sec ---\n","The attack, which killed 270 people in the plane and on the ground, remains the deadliest terrorist incident ever to have taken place on British soil.He always denied he had been responsible, but a series of appeals was halted when he was diagnosed with cancer and, controversially, released from prison in Scotland on compassionate grounds.Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi was born in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, on 1 April 1952.He studied in the US and also visited Britain \"four or five times\" during the 1970s when he is said to have spent nine months studying in Cardiff.He described himself as the former director of Libya's Centre for Strategic Studies, a role which - the FBI claimed - gave him cover to act as an intelligence officer for the Libyan Intelligence Services (JSO).Suggestions that he was related to the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, were never substantiated - but Megrahi had close connections to the Libyan government.He was a cousin of Said Rashid, a fellow senior JSO member and influential member of the government, who played a key role in Libya's anti-US policies during the 1980s.It was his role as chief of security for Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA) which, prosecutors later argued, allowed him to carry out the bombing.LAA had an office in Malta, where Libyans were able to move freely. From there, Megrahi was able to use as many as four false passports to travel to Zurich, where the timing device for the bomb was made.Pan Am flight 103 left London's Heathrow Airport at 1825 GMT on 21 Dec 1988, bound for New York with 243 passengers and 16 crew members on board.At just after 1900 an explosion in the plane's forward cargo hold tore the side out of the Boeing 747 which quickly broke up and fell onto the small town of Lockerbie in the Dumfries & Galloway region of Scotland.As well as the 259 people on board the plane, 11 residents of Lockerbie died on the ground as a result of a giant fireball caused when a wing holding thousands of gallons of fuel exploded on impact.It was scraps of clothes wrapped around the bomb which detonated aboard the airliner that led investigators to a shop in Malta and, eventually, to Megrahi.In November 1991 Megrahi, and a fellow Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, were indicted by the Scottish Lord Advocate and the US Attorney General for the bombing of Flight 103.Libya refused to extradite the two men and Megrahi spent eight years living under armed guard - relying on a small LAA pension and work as a teacher - before he and his co-defendant were handed over for trial.Eventually, after protracted negotiations with Libya, it was agreed the trial would be held under Scots law but in a neutral country.The two men were handed over in 1999 and the trial finally began in May 2000 at Camp Zeist, a former US Air Force base in the Netherlands.In television interviews shown to the court, Megrahi appeared gentle. He told reporters: \"I'm a quiet man. I never had any problem with anybody,\" and said he felt sorry for the people of Lockerbie.After nine months, three Scottish judges found him guilty and a subsequent appeal was rejected. He was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 27 years. Fhimah was acquitted of all charges.Megrahi served the first part of his sentence in Glasgow's Barlinnie prison, segregated in a high-security area dubbed \"Gaddafi's Cafe\", where there was said to be a sitting room and kitchen where halal food was specially prepared.The former South African president Nelson Mandela, who had helped broker the deal which allowed the trial to take place, visited him there and called for him to be moved to a Muslim country to avoid harassment from other prisoners.However, in 2005, he was transferred to nearby HMP Greenock, where there were no special provisions and he mixed with other \"lifers\".Megrahi was given a fresh chance to clear his name when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) referred his case back to appeal judges for a second time.In October 2008 It was announced that Megrahi was suffering from prostate cancer and his lawyers urged the court to speed up the appeal process.The hearing, which began in April  2009, had the backing of ex-Labour MP Tam Dalyell and Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing.However, in Aug 2009, Megrahi abruptly withdrew his appeal and on 20 August the Scottish Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill, granted his release on compassionate grounds and he was flown back to Libya.The decision caused a storm of protest from politicians in both the UK and the United States, not least because of what was termed his \"hero's welcome\" when he arrived home in Tripoli.The UK justice secretary, Jack Straw, was forced to publicly deny allegations that the British government had sanctioned Megrahi's release in the interests of improving trade relations with Libya.Megrahi always maintained that he was innocent, a view that was shared by some commentators and relatives of the victims.In a statement released by his lawyers, Megrahi said: \"Many people, including the relatives of those who died in, and over, Lockerbie, are, I know, upset that my appeal has come to an end; that nothing more can be done about the circumstances surrounding the Lockerbie bombing. I share their frustration. I had most to gain and nothing to lose about the whole truth coming out - until my diagnosis of cancer.\"Considerable doubt has been raised over the safety of Megrahi's conviction, and a number of conspiracy theories have circulated over the years as to who was responsible for the outrage.The withdrawal of his second appeal, and his subsequent death, has, according to some observers, made it less likely that the truth about the bombing of Pan Am 103 will ever be known.\n"," Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on 21 Dec 1988.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 69 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 20.746979542573293  min ---  1244.8187742233276  sec ---\n","At least 44 more have been injured in the crush, which was reportedly triggered by a road accident.The pilgrims were returning from the Hindu shrine of Sabarimala, which is in a remote, mountainous, densely-forested area.Kerala Governor R S Gavai has said he is \"deeply shocked and saddened\".\"We have recovered 102 bodies.

He was captured in July 2004 and transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006.Last year, the US stayed proceedings in a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay and transferred him to New York for the civilian trial.\n"," The first Guantanamo detainee to be tried in a US civilian court has been sentenced to life in prison.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 71 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 21.136902360121407  min ---  1268.2141435146332  sec ---\n","Set two years later on from This is England '86, the two-hour drama will deal with the aftermath of the events in that four-part series.\"Just when I think my love affair with This is England is over, it pulls me back in,\" Meadows said.Channel 4 has also confirmed that This is England '90, set in the rave era, is currently in development.Picking up the action at Christmas 1988, the story will focus on the relationship between the Lol and Woody characters.Meadows told the Stage newspaper that while Channel 4 \"would have happily had me go straight to 1990, I felt I needed something in-between.\"Channel 4's head of drama Camilla Campbell said: \"We're beyond excited that Shane, Warp Films and the cast have agreed to return with this feature length drama.\"It is set to pull together a lot of story threads from '86, leaving the way clear for a new series of This is England '90.\"This is England '86, which screened on Channel 4 last September, was named best TV drama at the South Bank Awards on Tuesday.The original film, written and directed by Meadows in 2006, told of an impressionable young boy who becomes involved with a gang of skinheads.\n"," Writer Shane Meadows is to make a one-off Christmas special to follow on from the This is England film and TV series.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 72 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 21.422394641240437  min ---  1285.343680381775  sec ---\n","Within minutes, water cannon showered the demonstrators and there were loud thuds as tear gas canisters were fired.People ran into the side streets of this poor neighbourhood, on the edge of the capital, with their eyes streaming.\"Let the world see what is happening in this country,\" yelled one elderly man. \"We will never stop until this... government goes.\"Ordinary Egyptians appear to be losing their fear of direct confrontation with the security forces.

One group was asked to begin an exercise regimen of walking around a track for 40 minutes a day, three days a week, while the others were limited to doing simple stretching and toning exercises.Brain scans and memory tests were performed at the start of the study, halfway through the study and again at the end.Scans revealed hippocampus volume increased by around 2% in people who did regular aerobic exercise. The same region of the brain decreased in volume by 1.4% in those who did stretching exercises, consistent with the decrease seen in normal ageing.Both groups showed some improvement over time on memory tests.

His visit to the United States was the first by a Burmese leader in 46 years.Thein Sein, 67, took office in March 2011, after the country's first election in 20 years in November 2010. Since then, he has led a process of reform in Myanmar, ruled for decades by a military junta of which he was a key member.Under his administration the government has freed hundreds of prisoners, including political detainees, embarked on peace deals with ethnic minority groups and relaxed media censorship.He has been welcomed cautiously onto the world stage, despite warnings from critics that many key tests remain for Myanmar's reform process.This warning was echoed in November 2014 by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said that the pace of reform had stalled.Born in a small village in the delta of the Irrawaddy river, in an area now known as Ngapudaw township, Thein Sein was from a humble background.  His parents were farmers, he said.He graduated with an arts degree from Burma's military academy in 1968 and rose steadily through the ranks in his 40-year career.He reached the leadership circle in the 1990s when he became a member of the State Peace and Development Council, as the junta called itself at the time.He was made first secretary of the council after the downfall of former intelligence chief General Khin Nyunt in 2004. Thein Sein also chaired the National Convention, which drafted the country's new constitution.When the previous prime minister, Soe Win, fell ill, Thein Sein was made acting prime minister in May 2007.Confirmed in the post in October that year, he became the public face of the regime, representing it at Asean and UN meetings. He served as prime minister for four years.In April 2010, like many other top junta officials, he swapped military uniform for civilian garb to form a political party.It was Thein Sein who applied to register the United Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which dominated the elections in November 2010 and has sweeping control of the parliament.Analysts said at the time that his appointment was orchestrated by junta leader Than Shwe, who needed an acceptable face to front the country's transition.\"He won't rock the boat,\" said Aung Zaw, editor of the Thailand-based Irrawaddy magazine, speaking when he took office.\"He is not a fire-breathing dragon, so he doesn't pose any threat to Than Shwe, who will continue to exercise absolute power.\"But once he took office, Thein Sein's government began a process of change that surprised his critics.He met freed pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who subsequently chose to bring her NLD party back into the political process, having boycotted the November polls.The NLD contested by-elections which were deemed by observers to be largely free and fair.Over the years since her release Thein Sein appears to have developed a good working relationship with Ms Suu Kyi.   Media reports made much of the fact that he met her, congratulated her on receiving the US Congressional Medal of Honor and referred to her as a Nobel laureate publicly.Known to be quiet by nature, Thein Sein has engaged more with international media.  He began a steady push for the West to lift sanctions, something he said was a necessity for democracy to thrive and the lives of Myanmar's people to improve.\"There is a quiet determination to him, he is quiet and soft-spoken but will not flinch from a question posed to him,\" Vijay Nambiar, the UN's top adviser on Myanmar, told Bloomberg.Asked in a BBC interview whether he was afraid he would be swept away by the winds of change like Mikhail Gorbachev after the fall of the Soviet Union, Thein Sein answered: \"I would like to say that Gorbachev and I are not alike, I tell you that.''We are not making reforms because I want to. We are merely responding to the people's desire for reform. Therefore my future depends on the people and their wishes.\"But he was clear that the military would always have a key role in politics. He also made no apology for its past actions, such as imprisoning dissidents and activists.\"They were acting on their beliefs and we were acting on our beliefs,\" he said. \"Everyone was working for the country in their own way.\"\n"," Myanmar's President Thein Sein, a former general, may go down in history as the man who led \"irreversible change\".\n","\n","Predicting summary for 77 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 23.233399871985117  min ---  1394.0039942264557  sec ---\n","This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since.Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks.I like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline.This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square.At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through.I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet.Twitter: Amr GharbeiaI was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground.At first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping.Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom.Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people.Twitter: Nawara NegmI'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square.The internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger.In the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution.Blog: MaLek X (in Arabic)The revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far.To begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard.After our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died.Still the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years.\"People have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked.In the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to.We're finally getting to know each other.

The day of live Beatles music starts with a lunchtime session at 1300 GMT.A 40-metre long light installation is being created across Mathew Street, called Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It will create a ceiling of light along the Cavern Quarter area.The original Cavern had started life as a jazz venue in 1957 but by 1961 it was moving towards rock and roll - driven more by plain economics than any change in musical taste.Promoter Sam Leach was instrumental in transforming the Cavern's music policy away from the jazz favoured by owner Ray McFall.Mr Leach said: \"It was a good club and it was exciting.\"Ray McFall hated rock and roll. On March 11th 1961, I did the Iron Door (a rival Liverpool club)  - I did an all night session and it got 1,800 people, that night the Cavern had 50 people in, more musicians than fans.\"Ten days later...Ray gets the message and he turns over to rock and roll at night. Up until then The Beatles only played at lunchtime.\"The Beatles had played other Merseyside venues since returning from Hamburg in late 1960, but it was at the Cavern that they would cement their reputation as one of the city's top rock and roll groups.Many who saw The Beatles at the club claim that was where they were at their best as a live outfit. Mr Leach's first taste of The Beatles was at a venue in Huyton.He said: \"When I first saw them in Hamilton Hall as soon as they started playing, I was just gobsmacked.\"The sound didn't just go over you it went through you.\"John Lennon started with Slow Down and Paul did Hippy Hippy Shake, Stuart did Wooden Heart, Pete Best did Matchbox. The sound was so powerful, it seemed to reverberate around the hall.\"We more or less took American rock and roll and sent it back at them improved. We gave them better sound, which was Merseybeat.\"Make no mistake the Cavern has become the most famous club in the world.\"It makes me smile when they say: 'The Cavern where it all began' - they were the last ones in. But it was an exciting club.\"In November 1961, record store manager Brian Epstein saw The Beatles at the Cavern and soon after became their manager.A record deal with Parlophone would follow but not before the band's sound and image had been subtlety changed.\"The Beatles were the best rock band on the planet\", Mr Leach remembers.\"Eppy [Brian Epstein] took them and he groomed them, and took all that rawness out of them, and fair enough it worked. But I know John didn't like it because John was an out and out rock and roller.\"Paul was sensible he knew you had to sort of bend a little bit and become a bit more showbiz.

The shaft was never built and the current Cavern club is recreated across three quarters of the original site, using many of the old club's bricks.Exactly three year's after their first Cavern appearance on 9 February, 1964, The Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show playing to a record 73 million people across America.Beatlemania had arrived.\n"," Fifty years ago, a young group stepped on stage in a dark cellar club on Liverpool's Mathew Street for the first of what would be almost 300 appearances.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 80 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 24.265424903233846  min ---  1455.9254965782166  sec ---\n","So what is the levy? What's really at stake? And why raise the rate now?What is the bank levy?It is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that:Originally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May.The standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January.What's it for?The government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous.The tax will also raise a lot of money for the government.So will this help deal with the budget deficit?The Treasury hopes the tax will bring in £2.6bn every year.That's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year.It's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five.What's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage?Traditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies.But during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets.Unlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again.A lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days.When the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts.This caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend.Unable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure.Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy?Bank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock.But since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs. Indeed, the government responded to the Northern Rock crisis by promising to guarantee all of its deposits.In the UK, the first £85,000 of an individual's money is insured (it used to be £35,000 before the financial crisis).This means that most depositors do not need to worry about the safety of their money during a financial crisis, and the banks don't need to worry about all those deposits being withdrawn.So why not just insure all the banks' borrowings?The bank levy was actually first proposed to all countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a type of insurance scheme.The IMF said the money raised should be channelled into a special fund that could be used to pay for the cost of cleaning up future banking crises.However, the UK government took the view that these borrowings are inherently risky, and wanted to discourage them altogether by taxing them.If the debts were insured, lenders would see them as less risky, making them a cheaper and easier way for banks to borrow.The government's fear is that the banks would then just continue taking on more and more debt, until they became impossibly large to rescue - as proved the case in the Republic of Ireland or Iceland.Indeed, the total debts of the UK's banks had already reached a staggering 4.5 times the size of the entire UK economy before the crisis.Some might also point out another reason why the government chose not to go for an insurance scheme.By making it a tax instead, the revenue raised can be channelled straight to the Treasury, helping to pay for the government's own spending.Why is the first £20bn of debts exempt from the tax?The government wants to encourage banks to shrink.The thinking is that the collapse of a big bank could threaten the stability of the entire financial system, whereas the failure of a small bank should not.The £20bn figure is about the size of the Coventry Building Society. So it means banks will only pay the tax to the extent they are bigger than that.Why is the tax rate lower on long-term debts?Longer-term debts are inherently less risky.Financial crises - at least the most intense part of them - tend to be over in a matter of a few weeks or months.If a bank does not have to repay its debts for more than a year, then it can probably ride out the crisis.Will the levy really discourage banks?The tax will increase the cost of \"risky\" short-term borrowing for banks by just under one-tenth of a percentage point.This may seem small, but it will eat into the banks' precious margins - the difference between the interest they pay on their deposits and what they earn on their lending - which is their main source of income.However, the banks may pass some of the tax cost on to their savers (via a lower deposit rate) or their borrowers (via a higher lending rate).But to get the 0.088% in context, the Bank of England slashed short-term borrowing costs by 5.2 percentage points in response to the financial crisis.Why did the government want to phase the levy in?The original plan was to charge 0.05% for 2011, before going up to the full 0.075% rate next year (increased to 0.078% in March).The government didn't want to raise the banks' borrowing costs at a time when their financial stability was still in question.They also did not want to sap the banks' profits too quickly.The banks might need to use all the profits they could get to rebuild their capital - their buffer against future losses - in order to meet tough new international standards being set by the Basel committee of banking regulators.So why did the government change its mind?In February, the Treasury said it wanted to charge the full £2.6bn this year after all.It pointed to the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, which painted a much rosier picture of the UK's banks.Moreover, the new Basel rules on bank capital won't take full effect until 2019, giving banks a full eight years to meet the higher standards.It probably also helped that the banks have been reporting much better profits than many would have expected a year ago.And markets seemed less and less concerned about the risk of lending to banks - at least until the eurozone debt crisis flared up since the summer of 2011.Why is the government raising the rate again?The chancellor raised the rate to 0.088% in his Autumn Statement.According to the Treasury, the tax was not on course to raise the £2.6bn originally planned for this year.The Treasury said that it had simply overestimated how much borrowing is done by foreign banks in the UK - and is therefore subject to the tax.It could also be that banks have been reducing their borrowing. Foreign banks may be moving their borrowing offshore to avoid the tax.And all banks may be cutting back their borrowing and lending requirements in response to the recession, the eurozone financial crisis, and stricter regulatory requirements.Which banks will have to pay most?The Treasury does not say how much of its £2.6bn target it expects to be paid by each bank.British banks face a bigger burden than foreign banks that do business in the UK, because the British banks must pay the levy on all their borrowing worldwide, and not just on their borrowing in the UK.That has led to suggestions that some banks - perhaps Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays - may relocate their headquarters to another country in order to reduce their tax bill.Moreover, the probability is that the tax will hit Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group hardest.It may seem perverse to tax most heavily the two banks in which the government has the biggest stake.But one of the reasons the government ended up owning these banks is precisely because they (in the case of Lloyds, because of its merger with the Halifax) had become too dependent on riskier forms of financing, and had to be rescued during the crisis.\n"," The government says it will increase the levy on banks from 0.078% to 0.088% from 1 January.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 81 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 24.67193148136139  min ---  1480.3158903121948  sec ---\n","Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club:\"I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session.\"The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse.

The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.\"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again.

A documentary about the first gig will be broadcast on ITV1 at 2240 GMT on Wednesday.\n"," It was 50 years ago today that The Beatles played their first gig at the Cavern Club in Liverpool - the venue where the band built their reputation and where Beatlemania was born.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 82 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 25.263809637228647  min ---  1515.828580379486  sec ---\n","During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK.He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees.Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge.Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London.His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton.They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised.In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics.He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin.In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London.His mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees.He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France.British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home.He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home.Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of  initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories.Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy.\"The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,\" he said.\"It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help.\"I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had.\"In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden.The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two.\"Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,\" Winton later recalled. \"None of the 250 children on board was seen again.\"We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through.\"Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned.He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children.In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend.Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them.Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport.In 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.A train dubbed \"The Winton Train\" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital.In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion.In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: \"In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today.\"It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis:\"In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed.\"The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference.

Mr Besigye and his wife have one son.He was born in the western Rukungiri District, the second child in a family of six and the son of a policeman.Besigye's dates with history:Both his parents died while he was at secondary school.In 1975, he headed to Kampala and to medical school at what was then the region's most prestigious university, Makerere.Idi Amin was president of Uganda at the time and his army was causing misery in many areas of the country, including on the university campus.Mr Besigye did not escape that treatment. Aged 18, he was in a Kampala hotel about to have dinner. Walking to the toilets, he stopped to talk to a former classmate.A huge man lifted him up by the collar, slapped him hard across the face and sent him sprawling to the floor.He said he never made it to the toilets, and never ate his dinner. He picked himself up and ran for his life.Following Amin's overthrow, the qualified doctor became a member of the Uganda People's Movement of Yoweri Museveni.The movement had little success in the 1980 election which saw the return of Milton Obote to power, and which is widely considered to have been rigged.Mr Besigye told the East African newspaper that he did not immediately join Mr Museveni in the bush war.But he was imprisoned for two months in the Nile Hotel in 1981, accused of working with the rebels, and tortured.Mr Besigye fled to Nairobi and in 1982 joined Mr Museveni in the bush, where he became his personal doctor.Although rarely at the battle front, Mr Besigye was deployed in divisions which were sent into battle where he treated the casualties.Kizza Besigye on his 2001-2005 exile:\"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened\"When Mr Museveni came to power, Mr Besigye, aged just 29, was appointed state minister of internal affairs and national political commissar.These appointments shocked some who had been in the bush with Mr Besigye, as he had not been heavily involved in the political side of the bush war.Some believe Mr Besigye's rapid rise led to him being viewed as a potential threat to the president, and as a result he was given less demanding work during the 1990s.Mr Besigye rose to the rank of colonel in the army but did not retire from it until shortly before the 2001 elections - having written a document that accused the ruling National Resistance Movement of being undemocratic, dishonest and corrupt. It almost earned him a court martial.A few months before the election, he emerged as a presidential candidate.Having lost to Mr Museveni, he went to court and challenged the result on the grounds that the state had used force, intimidation and violence.He lost the case on a split decision and then fled the country.On his return in 2005 he said: \"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened.\"More on Uganda's election:After he returned to Uganda ahead of the 2006 elections, he was arrested and charged with both treason and rape.The charges were later dismissed, but not until long after the polls and they obviously distracted him from campaigning.The rape prosecution was dismissed as \"crude and amateurish\" but the treason charges hung over his head until 2010.His lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the 2006 results, alleging widespread fraud. Mr Besigye won 37%.The government says Mr Besigye has connections with a rebel group, and this accusation led to charges.He denied any rebel link, although he has said he would not rule out going to the bush to battle the government if the constitution was overthrown and needed to be reinstated.After he lost the last election in 2011, Mr Besigye said all the votes were flawed.Before the 2011 polls, Mr Besigye had called for popular uprisings in the event of fraud.And after gaining 26% to the president's 68% in the vote, the leader of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) claimed it was rigged.After the election he continued to campaign against the result, along with the rising cost of living, by staging \"walk to work\" protests.He was arrested four times, accused of inciting violence and beaten by police during the protests before all charges were dropped.Human rights groups condemned the brutality of the police and military.His critics see him as a power-hungry attention seeker. But others praise him for standing up to authority.Mr Besigye himself says his mission is \"to work with millions of other Ugandans in bringing about a stable democratic and peaceful Uganda\".\n"," Kizza Besigye used to be President Yoweri Museveni's personal doctor but he went on to become an opposition leader and has referred to Uganda's leader as a \"dictator\".\n","\n","Predicting summary for 86 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 26.485158356030784  min ---  1589.1095032691956  sec ---\n","Almost completely cut off for centuries, it has tried to let in some aspects of the outside world while fiercely guarding its ancient traditions.The Bhutanese name for Bhutan, Druk Yul, means \"Land of the Thunder Dragon\" and it only began to open up to outsiders in the 1970s.The Wangchuck hereditary monarchy has wielded power since 1907.

Others managed to crawl out of the rubble.By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC NewsBy nature, earthquakes tend to cluster in space and time.And Tuesday's tremor in Christchurch is almost certainly related to the much more energetic event that hit the region last September.The critical difference on this occasion is the ground broke almost directly under the country's second city, and at shallow depth, 5km (3 miles) below the surface.Contrast this with September's magnitude 7 quake: its epicentre occurred some 40km west of the city and at a depth of 10km, and it continued to rupture mainly away from the major built-up areas.New Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.The country straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates: the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates.On South Island, the location of the latest quake, the plates rub past each other horizontally.Depth and location keyThe tremor sent the spire of Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark in the centre of the city, toppling into the square below.John Gurr, a camera technician, told Reuters news agency the area outside the cathedral was \"like a warzone\".Power and telephone lines have been knocked out, while burst pipes have deluged streets with water.The suburbs of Lyttelton and New Brighton are reportedly \"unliveable\".Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had been \"utterly shocked\" by the news.\"My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this dreadful event,\" the statement said.The quake caused some 30m tons of ice to shear away from New Zealand's biggest glacier.Witnesses say massive icebergs formed when the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park broke, tossing a nearby lake with huge waves.Back in Christchurch, emergency shelters were set up in the city's Hagley Park, a race course and schools as night approached.City Mayor Bob Parker told the BBC: \"This is a terrible, terrible toll on our city.\"\"There is no power in most of the city; there is no water in most of the city,\" he added.PM John Key said: \"It is just a scene of utter devastation. We have to work as fast as we can to get people out of environments where they are trapped.\"This is a community that is absolutely in agony.

Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person.Craig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off.\"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\"But Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs.Ever since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream.Peter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking.Professor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis.He cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing.\"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\"But he thinks the long-term research is equally important.\"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize.His boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example.There is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\"It is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line.Big, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft.\"We don't feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\"And he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end.\"I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\"Microsoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.\n"," If you spent $9bn a year on research and development and employed 900 of the world's top computer scientists to come up with new ideas, what would you expect in return?\n","\n","Predicting summary for 93 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 28.47124224503835  min ---  1708.2745368480682  sec ---\n","A former field marshal, three generals and six admirals say the loss of Ark Royal and its fleet of Harrier jets has damaged Britain's defence capabilities.They say Britain can no longer mount amphibious operations without putting troops' lives at \"considerable risk\".Defence Secretary Liam Fox has defended the \"difficult decisions\".The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, said the letter, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, raises questions about what military rescue operation forces could mount in the future.In December, Dr Fox announced that the frigate sent to evacuate British nationals from Libya - HMS Cumberland - is to be decommissioned in April, following the strategic defence and security review (SDSR).Our correspondent says this is not the first time former military top brass have warned that recent cuts in the armed forces have left Britain dangerously exposed.Labour has already called for the defence review to be reopened in light of events in Egypt, Bahrain and Libya.The letter - written before the current evacuation operation in Libya - is signed by, among others, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former chief of the defence staff; Maj Gen Julian Thompson and Adm Sir Jeremy Black, who commanded the carrier Invincible during the Falklands conflict.Dr Fox insists Britain still has the \"right military assets\" in place to respond to crises.But this group of former military commanders is calling on the prime minister to reassess the decisions made in the defence review.They have called for a re-evaluation of the SDSR, which they say is \"unduly trusting in an uncertain, fast-moving and dangerous world\".However Dr Fox defended the steps taken to tackle the Â£38bn deficit left by Labour and said the review would not be reopened.\"For our future carrier strike capability, it makes strategic sense to move towards greater inter-operability with the US and France and installing catapult and arrestor gear will deliver this.\"Sustaining both Tornado and Harrier would be prohibitively expensive in this current economic climate and Tornado continues to provide vital support to the front line in Afghanistan,\" he said.Referring to Libya, he said Hercules C-130 aircraft had lifted 51 UK citizens to safety on Thursday - and more than 100 were on their way to Malta on HMS Cumberland.\"None of our allies have seen fit to position an aircraft carrier off the coast of Libya as this is not the tool required for this task; there is no requirement for ground attack aircraft, but even if there were we would use our extensive regional basing and overflight rights,\" he said.But shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: \"The government's plans were based on strategic and international geo-political assumptions, many of which have been shaken over the past month.\"Recent dramatic events mean that the defence review must be reopened and perhaps even rethought.

(It happened nearly two years ago when China's central bank governor published a series of essays on reserve currencies and reform to the international financial system.)The environment minister's statement is an open call for a paradigm shift away from the model of high input, high resource consumption, and high pollution, to sustainable growth to ease the conflict between economic and social development, and the environmental damage it has caused in the past three decades.Chinese scholars say China's energy intensity per unit of GDP is at least five times that of Japan. Social stability is another factor as more people are enraged by worsening air, water and soil pollution.It remains to be seen if his call will be translated into real action as China's economic engine roars ahead.\"In China's thousands of years of civilisation, the conflict between humanity and nature has never been as serious as it is today,\" he wrote.\"The depletion, deterioration and exhaustion of resources and the deterioration of the environment have become serious bottlenecks constraining economic and social development.\"China, he said, would suffer unless issues of air and water pollution were prioritised.He suggested that his ministry should take on a greater role in tackling greenhouse gas emissions and that new development projects  be assessed for their impact on climate change.In recent decades, development has been prioritised over the environment, meaning that China now has some of the most polluted skies and waterways in the world.It relies heavily on coal and is the world's leading CO2 emitter. It overtook the US as the world's biggest car and van market in 2009.In recent years there have been numerous examples of industrial spills or dumping that have damaged waterways and in some cases harmed residents.The BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says that the government has repeatedly promised to tackle pollution, but then failed to enforced these decisions.\n"," The man in charge of protecting China's environment has warned that pollution and the demand for resources threaten to choke economic growth.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 95 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 29.149133598804475  min ---  1748.948017835617  sec ---\n","The discovery was made during work to extend the castle's main shop and ticket office.Historic Scotland said the find would help establish exactly where the defences stood.European experts are believed to have been used to apply the latest Italian military engineering techniques at the castle in the 1540s.They were brought in by Mary of Guise, widow of James V, at a time when intermittent warfare with England made it essential to have fortifications that could protect against heavy artillery in a siege.The defences are shown in a 17th Century engraving by John Slezer.Gordon Ewart, of Kirkdale Archaeology - whose team discovered the walling - said: \"We knew the defences would have been in this area, but not exactly where because the Slezer engraving, and remaining military plans, are not entirely accurate.\"This is what makes the discovery of physical evidence so important - it helps us identify exactly what existed - and to understand more about what the castle was like in the past.\"Much was changed at the castle between 1711-14 when the old defences were demolished during a programme of modernisation.Further alterations took place when the esplanade was created in the early 19th Century.Peter Yeoman, from Historic Scotland, said the discovery gave a \"tantalising glimpse\" of the fortifications created for Mary of Guise and paid for by the French king Henri II.Mr Yeoman said they were probably designed by the Italian engineer Signor Ubaldini, who was working on a similar defensive spur at the time at Edinburgh Castle.He added: \"They are of great interest because they were early examples of a changing approach to military engineering, and among the most advanced in the whole of the British isles.\"\n"," Archaeologists have found fragments of Stirling Castle's 16th Century outer defences.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 96 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 29.495071244239806  min ---  1769.7042770385742  sec ---\n","Here are some of the clips from our interviews hosted by Andrew Neil and Jo Coburn, with films from our reporting team.Follow us on twitter or 'like' us on  Facebook where we look forward to your comments and you can hear more news about upcoming guests and films.When Parliament is sitting, the Daily Politics is on BBC2 from 1200-1300 on weekdays, with an 1130 start on Wednesdays for PMQs, and the Sunday Politics is on BBC1 from 1100-1215, occasionally moving for live sport and news events.Both have a repeat on BBC Parliament at midnight, and are on BBC iPlayer for 30 days.DP and SP Facebook site with more interviews and picturesIs the PM's EU renegotiation progressing?How the smaller parties did in 2015A look back at UKIP's yearA look back at Labour's yearHas 2015 been a good year for the Tories?Who is 2015's Daily Politics Secret Santa?Is another recession coming and are we ready?LGA chief on local government financesWhat can we learn from election-themed books?What do the EU referendum polls say?Peers discuss Lords reform plansEdward Docx's pro-EU Christmas poemJohn Redwood's 'Brexit fairy tale'Jon Culshaw's review of the yearShould fracking under national parks be allowed?Latest on UK's EU renegotiation talksShould Prince Charles receive cabinet papers?Panel on final PMQs of 2015Soapbox: Should motorists over 70 be retested?Guests discuss retesting for motorists aged over 70Is Star Wars left or right-wing?Should there be a Lib-Lab pact?

And commentators say this could pose an impediment to the future expansion of the private forensics market.Some forensic scientists have expressed dismay at the FSS's closure, voicing concerns about the quality of science, the retention of expertise and the future of forensic research and development (R&D) once the service is closed down.In a letter to New Scientist magazine in January, Professor Alec Jeffreys, who pioneered the technique of genetic fingerprinting at the University of Leicester, said the decision to close the FSS could not be in the interests of justice.\"Who will provide the expertise for complex and interdisciplinary investigations, and who will develop and refine new technologies? The private sector is most unlikely to fill this void,\" he wrote.As reported by BBC News last month, Peter Gill, professor of forensic genetics at the University of Oslo, said there was a mismatch between the government's aim to commercialise forensic science and the requirement of courts for openness.He added that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details were kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues.Mr Brokenshire has said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. This course is questioned by Prospect union, which represents scientists and engineers, in their evidence to the inquiry.\"Currently the forensic science regulator sits in the Home Office, but... Prospect understands that there are very limited powers and no statutory influence,\" the union wrote.It added: \"Additional regulatory powers will be needed to ensure that there is a level playing field between police forces and private contractors. It will also be essential to ensure that forensic science practitioners have recognisable and respected qualifications and a professional code of ethics.\"Professor Allan Jamieson, director of the Forensic Institute in Glasgow, which is a commercial supplier of forensic services, said there was \"no reason to expect that, if properly managed, this market cannot deliver the required service at a fair price\".But he highlighted the need for the involvement of the wider scientific community in UK forensic science to prevent it from becoming isolated.\"It cannot be known whether any provider has met the scientific standard if there is no scientific research to measure the standard against,\" he wrote in his submission.\"Perhaps properly funding this essential research is the obvious, logical, and necessary step to prevent the feared decline of standards in forensic science.\"The FSS is headquartered in Birmingham, with a number of laboratories around England and Wales; it has already closed laboratories at Chepstow and central Birmingham to help bring costs under control. The service previously employed about 1,600 staff.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n"," The closure of the Forensic Science Service should have no negative impact on criminal justice as long as the wind down is properly handled, commercial providers have told a Commons inquiry.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 98 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 30.47803335984548  min ---  1828.6820034980774  sec ---\n","Several decades later it had become, in the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India's \"greatest internal security challenge\".Maoists are also known as \"Naxalites\" because of the violent left-wing uprising in 1967, which began in the West Bengal village of Naxalbari.Although this was eventually quashed by police, over the years India's Maoists have regrouped and asserted control over vast swathes of land in central and eastern India, establishing a so-called \"red corridor\".This spans the states of Jharkand, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh and also reaches into Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka.The Maoists and affiliated groups are active in more than a third of India's 600-odd districts, the authorities say.And more than 6,000 people have died in the rebels' long fight for communist rule in these states.The Maoists' military leader is Koteshwar Rao, otherwise known as Kishenji.He reportedly suffered temporary paralysis in June 2010 when a police bullet hit him in the knee.Normally a regular communicator with the press, Kishenji was little heard of until January 2011 when he issued a statement saying he expected India to succumb to a Maoist revolution by 2025.Latest estimates suggest he commandes at least 20,000 armed fighters. They are said to get most of their weapons by raiding police bases.Analysts say the longevity of the Maoist rebellion is partly due to the local support they receive.The rebels say they are fighting for the rights of indigenous tribespeople and the rural poor who they say have been neglected by governments for decades.Maoists claim to represent local concerns over land ownership and equitable distribution of resources.Ultimately they say they want to establish a \"communist society\" by overthrowing India's \"semi-colonial, semi-feudal\" form of rule through armed struggle.The BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta says that while there is little prospect of them making any headway in urban areas - or indeed non-jungle rural areas - the rebels remain a force to be reckoned with in remote areas where the security forces are thin on the ground.Our correspondent says the key question now is whether to deploy the army against the rebels in the same way it has been used in Indian-administered Kashmir and some north-eastern states.Such a move would be highly controversial, because it would inevitably been seen by some critics as evidence that the rebels are making headway in what is seen by some as \"mainland India\".Over the years the Maoists have managed to launch a series of damaging attacks on Indian security forces.In 2009, rebels gained virtual control of Lalgarh district in West Bengal barely 250km (155 miles) from the state capital, Calcutta.For many months, rebels, supported by local villagers, held hundreds of paramilitary forces at bay. The Maoists declared it to be India's first \"liberated zone\" but Indian security forces finally overwhelmed the rebels.April 2010 saw rebels ambush paramilitary troops in the dense jungles of central Chhattisgarh state, killing at least 76 soldiers. Correspondents say it was the worst-ever Maoist attack on Indian security forces.In 2007, also in Chhattisgarh, Maoist rebels killed 55 policemen in an attack on a remote police outpost.Almost every week, Maoist rebels are blamed for minor skirmishes and incidents across India's north-east - common tactics include blowing up railway tracks and attacking police stations.In 2010, the Maoists faced India's biggest ever anti-Maoist offensive.Nearly 50,000 federal paramilitary troops and tens of thousands of policemen took part in the operation across several states.While the rebels were pushed back deep into their jungle strongholds, they have continued to carry out hit-and-run attacks and numerous high-profile kidnappings.India's government in turn has pledged to crack down even harder unless rebels renounce violence and enter peace talks.At the same time there have been differences not just within the central government over how to tackle the rebellion, but also between Delhi and various Indian states affected by the insurgency.Experts say that disagreements over whether to deploy the army against the rebels is a manifestation of these tensions.On one issue however the analysts remain united - the chances of any kind of meaningful dialogue with the rebels in the foreseeable future are slim.\n"," India's bloody Maoist insurgency began in the remote forests of the state of West Bengal in the late 1960s.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 99 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 30.81710818608602  min ---  1849.0264930725098  sec ---\n","The former Manchester United captain wants to build the futuristic four-bedroom property on greenbelt moorland between Bolton and Bury.The partially-underground house was labelled a \"Teletubbies\" home because of its petal-shaped design.The planning committee approved the development by 12 votes to nine.The application will now be referred to the Government Office for the North West for consideration.The 36-year-old plans to have the kitchen in the flower's stigma, with its petals being bedrooms, bathrooms, a garage, a children's play area and a swimming pool.The planning application was turned down when it went before the planning committee last June.Officers from Bolton Council recommended its approval because of \"its exceptionally high quality of design\" and \"sensitive relationship with the surrounding landscape\".But committee members ignored the report's advice and voted 14-6 to refuse the application.The application was re-submitted with the height of a wind turbine lowered.A council spokeswoman said: \"The committee has approved the plans and the application will now be referred to the Government Office for the North West (GONW) for consideration.\"Should GONW consider it justified the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to intervene, and call in the application for him to consider.\"However, if the scheme is approved by GONW and the scheme is not called in for review, then the application will be referred back to the council.

Also from Spain, Gamesa has opted for Glasgow as a research base, while looking at Dundee for manufacturing and logistic support.The biggest commitment so far is from Doosan Power Systems, a subsidiary of the vast Doosan conglomerate based in South Korea. It is new into the wind turbine business, though it's not new to green energy research, as a partner with Scottish & Southern Energy on early stages of commercialising carbon capture and storage.The research and development centre comes first, with 500 jobs to follow in a turbine manufacturing plant. So far Scotland's only had one such plant, near Campbeltown, and it's had a troubled couple of years, with three owners. So Doosan's statement of intent is a sign that the green jobs potential and hopes may be moving towards reality.The jobs announcements were made by both companies, who were visited by First Minister Alex Salmond.Doosan intends to locate its research and development centre for renewables at its current site at Westway in Renfrew, creating up to 200 jobs.The Korean firm is also in talks with the business development agency, Scottish Enterprise, to set up manufacturing and assembly facilities in Scotland - its favoured location for wind turbine development and production.Doosan expects its offshore wind plans in Scotland to create up to 1,700 new jobs.The firm aims to directly recruit about 700 new staff, with a further 1,000 employed in associated supply companies.In a separate announcement, Steel Engineering, which is also based at Westway in Renfrew, said it aimed to create 120 jobs by expanding its business servicing a range of clean energy sectors, including offshore wind, wave and tidal power.The firm is getting a Â£1.8m government grant towards the Â£3m investment.Steel Engineering is also in talks with Skills Development Scotland about developing a training school with Anniesland College in Glasgow.This would aim to provide training tailored to the latest fabrication techniques, and welding procedures required by the renewables industry.Mr Salmond said both announcements were \"great news for Renfrew and for the wider Scottish economy\".He described the Doosan initiatives as \"another great stride forward for the renewables industry in Scotland - which is now the chosen destination for three energy engineering giants to design their next generation of turbines to service the global offshore wind industry\".The first minister added: \"Scotland also plays a key role in the energy industry supply chain and Steel Engineering are an excellent example of how Scottish companies with great experience servicing the offshore oil and gas industry have been building the renewables side of their business.\"\n"," Expansion plans by two engineering firms could create 820 new jobs in Scotland's renewable energy sector.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 102 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 31.513847176233927  min ---  1890.8308322429657  sec ---\n","Three fire engines were called to Railway Street, Tunstall, at about 2320 GMT on Tuesday.Crews brought the fire in the lounge under control within half an hour.

Mau Mau supporters took oaths, binding them to their cause.In October 1952 the British declared a state of emergency and began moving army reinforcements into Kenya.So began an aggressively fought counter-insurgency, which lasted until 1960 when the state of emergency was ended.The number killed in the uprising is a subject of much controversy. Officially the number of Mau Mau and other rebels killed was 11,000, including 1,090 convicts hanged by the British administration. Just 32 white settlers were killed in the eight years of emergency.However, unofficial figures suggest a much larger number were killed in the counter-insurgency campaign.The Kenya Human Rights Commission has said 90,000 Kenyans were executed, tortured or maimed during the crackdown, and 160,000 were detained in appalling conditions.David Anderson, professor of African Politics at Oxford University, says he estimates the death toll in the conflict to have been as high as 25,000.He said: \"Everything that could happen did happen. Allegations about beatings and violence were widespread. Basically you could get away with murder. It was systematic.\"The African Home Guard, recruited by the British, used oppressive violence as a means of controlling the population, Prof Anderson suggests.He said: \"The British armed the militia, rewarded them, incentivised them, allowing them to pillage property of the nationalists.\"Mau Mau families were subject to pillage by their neighbours. People would simply walk up to the farm and walk away with things.\"In addition to search-and-destroy missions against Mau Mau fighter bands operating in the forests, the British also strategically resettled Kikuyu in villages. They also detained some 100,000 Kikuyu without trial, often for periods of between three and seven years.London law firm Leigh Day & Co lodged a claim in mid-2009 on behalf of five elderly Kenyans. One has died since the case was lodged.The firm says its clients suffered terribly in detention camps or at the hands of British-led soldiers.Solicitor Martyn Day told the BBC: \"They were put in camps where they were subject to severe torture, malnutrition, beatings. The women were sexually assaulted. Two of the men were castrated. The most severe gruesome torture you could imagine.\"A lot of the officers involved were white, they were controlling the violence against these Mau Mau. It wasn't just isolated individual officers. It was systematic. The whole purpose was to break the Mau Mau.\"The UK says the claim is not valid because of the amount of time since the abuses were alleged to have happened, and that any liability rested with the Kenyan authorities after independence in 1963.But Leigh Day & Co says the case is an \"opportunity for the British government to come to terms with the past and apologise to the victims and the Kenyan people for this grave historic wrong\".South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu has backed their case.\"In my view, the British government's attempt to pin liability on Kenya for British colonial torture represents an intolerable abdication of responsibility,\" he said.\"Britain's insistence that international human rights standards should be respected by governments around the world will sound increasingly hollow if the door is shut in the face of these known victims of British torture.\"But it is clear that brutal violence was exacted on both sides.Prof Anderson explains: \"There was lots of suffering on the other side too. This was a dirty war. It became a civil war - though that idea remains extremely unpopular in Kenya today.\"One example was the Mau Mau raid on the \"loyalist\" village of Lari, where the majority of the men were away fighting with the British Home Guard. The rebels killed more than 70, mostly women and children.Tim Simmonds, who joined the Kenyan police reserve as a tracker shortly after settling in Kenya in 1954, says the Mau Mau fighters \"went on the rampage\", slaughtering thousands of people, leaving him so frightened he slept under his bed for a year.While deploring the treatment of detainees in the camps, he says he has no regrets about fighting the insurgents in the bush.\"They really got what they deserved. I'm really quite tough on this. If I had the chance again in the same situation, them killing people, would I go out and kill them again as I did? Yes sir I would.\"It has long been suggested that the suppression of the Mau Mau was more brutal in nature than the action taken against other colonial uprisings across the British Empire.Some historians have posited that white settler pressure on the British government and the characterisation of the Mau Mau fighters as the epitome of savagery may have been behind this.The Kikuyu themselves were split, with \"haves\" often siding with the British against Mau Mau \"have-nots\" and many happy to take the confiscated land of their fellow villagers.Prof Anderson notes that one of the things marking the battle against the Mau Mau was the number of hangings, with capital offences extended during the emergency to include \"consorting\" with Mau Mau.Some attention was paid to allegations of atrocities at the time, with questions asked in parliament about 11 Africans beaten to death in a British camp at Hola.Among those who spoke out were the Labour MP Barbara Castle and the Conservative Enoch Powell, now best known for his \"rivers of blood\" speech.He suggested at the time that if such killings were to go unpunished Britain did not deserve an empire.\"I would say it is a fearful doctrine, which must recoil upon the heads of those who pronounce it, to stand in judgment on a fellow human being and say, 'Because he was such-and-such, therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow.'\"Even though the Mau Mau were thoroughly defeated by 1960, the exact reforms that nationalists had been pressing for before the uprising had started and, by 1963, Kenya was independent.\n"," Legal action taken against the British government to secure compensation for four Kenyans allegedly tortured during the Mau Mau uprising will cast the spotlight on one of the Empire's bloodiest conflicts.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 107 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 32.83568003177643  min ---  1970.140804052353  sec ---\n","Many of the elements that make up the foundation of the modern world originated in China, including paper, gunpowder, credit banking, the compass and paper money.China stagnated for more than two decades under the rigid Communist rule of the founder of the People's Republic, Mao Zedong.But China now has the world's fastest-growing economy and is undergoing what has been described as a second industrial revolution.It has also launched an ambitious space exploration programme, involving plans to set up a space station by 2020.The People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the previously dominant nationalist Kuomintang in a civil war.The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the PRC on the mainland and the Republic of China based on Taiwan.China profile - homeCountry profiles - homeCountry profiles compiled by BBC MonitoringBeijing says the island of Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory that must be reunited with the mainland.The claim has in the past led to tension and threats of invasion, but since 2008 the two governments have moved towards a more cooperative atmosphere.The leadership of Mao Zedong oversaw the often brutal implementation of a Communist vision of society.Millions died in the Great Leap Forward - a programme of state control over agriculture and rapid industrialisation - and the Cultural Revolution, a chaotic attempt to root out elements seen as hostile to Communist rule.However, Mao's death in 1976 ushered in a new leadership and economic reform. In the early 1980s the government dismantled collective farming and again allowed private enterprise.The rate of economic change has not been matched by political reform, with the Communist Party - the world's largest political party - retaining its monopoly on power and maintaining strict control over the people.The authorities still crack down on any signs of opposition and send outspoken dissidents to labour camps.Nowadays China is one of the world's top exporters and is attracting record amounts of foreign investment. In turn, it is investing billions of dollars abroad.The collapse in international export markets that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2009 initially hit China hard, but its economy was among the first in the world to rebound, quickly returning to growth.In February 2011 it formally overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, though by early 2012 the debt crisis in the eurozone - one of the biggest markets for Chinese goods - was beginning to act as a drag on China's growth.As a member of the World Trade Organisation, China benefits from access to foreign markets. But relations with trading partners have been strained over China's huge trade surplus and the piracy of goods.The former has led to demands for Beijing to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi, which would make Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and possibly hold back exports. Beijing has responded with a gradual easing of restrictions on trading in the currency.Some Chinese fear that the rise of private enterprise and the demise of state-run industries carries heavy social costs such as unemployment and instability.Moreover, the fast-growing economy has fuelled the demand for energy. China is the largest oil consumer after the US, and the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. It spends billions of dollars in pursuit of foreign energy supplies. There has been a massive investment in hydro-power, including the $25bn Three Gorges Dam project.The economic disparity between urban China and the rural hinterlands is among the largest in the world. In recent decades many impoverished rural dwellers have flocked to the country's eastern cities, which have enjoyed a construction boom.By the beginning of 2012, city dwellers appeared to outnumber the rural population for the first time, according to official figures.Social discontent manifests itself in protests by farmers and workers. Tens of thousands of people travel to Beijing each year to lodge petitions with the authorities in the hope of finding redress for alleged corruption, land seizures and evictions.Other pressing problems include corruption, which affects every level of society, and the growing rate of HIV infection. A downside of the economic boom has been environmental degradation; China is home to many of the world's most-polluted cities.Human rights campaigners continue to criticise China for executing hundreds of people every year and for failing to stop torture, as well as for continuing to censor political and artistic expression.The country is keen to stamp down on what it sees as dissent among its ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uighurs in the north-west.Chinese rule over Tibet is controversial. Human rights groups accuse the authorities of the systematic destruction of Tibetan Buddhist culture and the persecution of monks loyal to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader who is campaigning for autonomy within China.\n"," China is the world's most populous country, with a continuous culture stretching back nearly 4,000 years.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 108 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 33.27130292654037  min ---  1996.2781777381897  sec ---\n","Peter Gillespie, 64, from Hertfordshire, was part of a £4.7m plot to bring two million doses of counterfeit drugs from China to the UK.He was convicted of conspiring to defraud pharmaceutical wholesalers, pharmacists and members of the public.He was convicted by a jury at Croydon Crown Court.By mimicking authentic, properly manufactured and tested medicines, Gillespie illegally infiltrated the regulated system designed to protect the public and pharmaceutical industry, the court heard.The counterfeit medicines contained only a fraction of the correct dosage.They included Zyprexa, a medicine to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Andrew Marshall, prosecuting, said patients had been put at risk by his fraud.\"This case is considered to represent the most serious breach of the medicine control regime - it's the most serious breach that has happened in the EU,\" he told jurors.\"It has had far-reaching effects for the pharmaceutical industry, control mechanisms, patients and the confidence of the public.\"The case arose from a £750,000 three-and-a-half-year investigation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Mick Deats, head of enforcement, said after the trial that 72,000 packs of counterfeit medicine - with a retail value of £4.7m - penetrated the UK supply chain between December 2006 and May 2007.Some 25,000 of these packs reached pharmacies and were given to patients.The MHRA was able to seize 40,000 before they got to pharmacies, and 7,000 were recovered following recalls.Although the drugs contained just 50% to 80% of the correct ingredients, Mr Deats did not believe they caused any fatalities or adverse reactions.At Croydon Crown Court, Gillespie, of High Street, Bovingdon, was also found guilty of selling or supplying drugs without a marketing authorisation  between January 2006 and June 2007.Jurors also found him guilty of a charge of acting as a company director while disqualified.Mr Deats added the MHRA now hoped to seize anything Gillespie obtained through his scam in a proceeds of crime hearing.Four other men - his brother Ian, 59, of The Green, Marsh Baldon, Oxfordshire; Richard Kemp, 61, of School Lane, Y Waen, Flint, north Wales; Ian Harding, 58, of Lower Westwood, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire; and James Quinn, 70, of Virginia Park, Virginia Water, Surrey - were acquitted of all charges.Another person connected to the case had already been convicted in the US.\n"," A man has been jailed for eight years for his part in what has been described as the most serious fake medicine fraud in the European Union.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 109 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 33.5200602610906  min ---  2011.2036175727844  sec ---\n","However his role as used-car salesman Arthur Daley, in the long-running TV series Minder, is the one for which he will be best remembered.His character became synonymous with dodgy dealing and phrases such as \"nice little earner\" and \"er indoors\" passed  into the national lexicon.As well as his numerous screen appearances, he also starred for 15 years in the BBC radio series A Life of Bliss, later adapted for TV.George Edward Cole was born in Tooting, south-west London  on 22 Apr 1925. His 16 year old mother abandoned him when he was just ten days old and he was adopted by the Cole family and  brought up on a London council estate.He left school at 14 intending to work as a butcher's boy but,  following the death of his adoptive father, ran away to Blackpool where he successfully auditioned for a part in a touring musical show.In 1940, he played a Cockney evacuee in Cottage To Let, first on stage and then on film. He had gone to the audition for the stage version purely to accompany a friend but ended up getting the part himself.\"I was always in plays at school and in school concerts,\" he said. \"You could say I liked to show off.\"Together with his adoptive mother, he was taken in by the  actor Alistair Sim and his wife, Naomi, and appeared with Sim in a number of plays.The Sims ruthlessly worked on ironing out his cockney vowels, determined that he shouldn't be type-cast.Cole joined the RAF in 1943, where he trained as a wireless operator. When it was discovered that his eyesight wasn't good he was removed from flying duties and transferred to Coastal Command HQ in Northwood before going to Allied occupied Germany to run the bar in an officers' mess.After the war he returned to acting and, by his late 20s, was a veteran of more than 30 films, few of them memorable, including a role as the love interest of a newly-emerging starlet called Joan Collins, in the 1951 film Bikini Babe.He did have a small role in Laurence Olivier's epic production of Henry V and was, at the time of his death, the last survivor of the huge cast.In 1953, he took over the role of David Bliss, the somewhat bumbling bachelor in the BBC radio comedy, A Life of Bliss. The series ran for 118 episodes, transferring briefly to television in the early 1960s.It was the 1954 film, The Belles of St Trinian's that brought him to the attention of a  wider audience and, incidentally, allowed him to establish the character of the cockney rogue that he would later portray in Minder.As the spiv, Flash Harry, he was a ready source of nylons for the girls in the school and drink for the teachers. The film featured his mentor, Alistair Sim in the dual roles of the headmistress and her crooked brother.He would go on to reprise the role in Blue Murder at St Trinian's in 1957, Blue Murder at St Trinian's in 1960 and The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery in 1966.He was seldom out of work, proving to be a versatile performer who could turn his hand to serious roles, as in The Inspector Calls and musicals like It's a Wonderful World.There was a minor role in the Taylor/Burton version of Cleopatra in 1963 and he even turned his hand to horror in the 1970s, with The Vampire Lovers, which shocked many with its lesbian love scenes.The following year, in another horror film, Fright, he found himself working alongside a young actor named Dennis Waterman - later to star alongside him in Minder.Cole was also shortlisted for the part of the butler, Hudson, in the London Weekend period drama, Upstairs, Downstairs, a role that eventually went to Gordon Jackson.He remained much in demand appearing in a variety of roles. These included playing the  potter, Josiah Wedgewood in a BBC drama, The Voyage of Charles Darwin and the unscrupulous MP, Sir Giles Lynchwood, in the BBC adaptation of Tom Sharpe's novel, Blott on the Landscape.In one scene of the latter production his character, a secret fetishist,  was left naked, trussed and bound on a bed by a  good natured, but particularly forgetful call girl, memorably played by Julia McKenzie.He also played the author, George Maple, in the BBC sitcom, Don't Forget to WriteIn 1979 he was offered the part of Arthur Daley in a comedy-drama called Minder, a role that would come to define his career.The character reflected the entrepreneurial era of Thatcher's Britain. \"In an era of greed, he was fairly greedy, but also so unsuccessful,\" Cole once recalled. \"He had the appeal of the eternal loser.\"Originally written as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman, Cole was not the first choice for the part but Waterman's preference for the actor, Denholm Eliot, was overruled by the producers, much to Waterman's annoyance.\"We circled round each other for three or four days,\" Cole later recalled. But the pair soon became close friends and developed a rapport on set that saw them improvising scenes to good effect.The drama ran for eleven series, with Gary Webster replacing Dennis Waterman as Terry in 1991, and delivered huge ratings figures for ITV.It also made Cole an unlikely pop star when  his duet with Dennis Waterman, \"What Are We Gonna Get 'Er Indoors?\", reached the UK Top Thirty in 1983.Although Cole was approaching 70 when Minder finally ended, he continued to work regularly into the new century with guest appearances in a number of series, including Midsomer Murders, and various film roles.He married the actress Eileen Moore in 1954 and the couple had two children. They divorced in 1962 after she left him for someone else. Cole subsequently married another actress, Penny MorrellA genial and warm-hearted man, Cole always had mixed feelings about the wheeler-dealer character that had brought him fame and fortune.\"I've earned a few sovs from him over the years, so I shouldn't complain, but he was a rogue; a dreadful character, really.

Radioactive debris was sent 30,000 feet into the air - the height at which airliners conventionally fly.Some of that debris came down thousands of kilometres away, in concentrations strong enough to prohibit the eating of meat and the drinking of milk produced locally.The upgrading of Japan's Fukushima incident to a level seven - the maximum - on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) puts it on a par with Chernobyl.And a spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which runs the plant, suggested it could even end up being worse than Chernobyl.This, though, appears to be a minority view among engineers - both those who generally support nuclear power, and those who have in the past voiced criticisms.Timeline: nuclear accidents\"The classification of seven means there's a leak of radiation into the wider environment; and although it'll be interpreted as being 'the same as Chernobyl', it's not the same,\" said Paddy Regan, professor of    physics at the UK's University of Surrey.\"The amount of radiation release is a lot less, and the way it's released is very different.\"The Chernobyl fire was putting lots of radioactive material into the atmosphere and taking it over large distances; here, there have been a couple of releases where they've vented [gas from] the reactor, and then released some cooling water.\"Don Higson, a retired Australian nuclear safety specialist, was more pithy.\"To my mind, [rating Fukushima equivalent to Chernobyl] would be nonsense,\" he said.In the month following the Chernobyl explosion, he said, 134 workers were hospitalised with acute radiation sickness and 31 died.The equivalent figures for Fukushima are none and none. (Although workers have been taken to hospital with radiation burns, this is not the same as acute radiation sickness.)So why the uprating?What it does not mean is that things have got worse at the plant; in fact, conditions appear to be markedly more stable than in the days following the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, although not completely under control.Rather, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) has re-analysed data from the incident and decided that collectively the releases of radioactivity mean it slots into a level seven categorisation.The manual for agencies using the INES scale, published by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), runs to 218 pages.One of the criteria for evaluating the severity of an incident is the total release of radioactive material.This is derived by first adding up the amounts of each different radioactive isotope released, then multiplying each by a conversion factor related to the characteristics of that particular isotope, then adding up all of the resulting numbers.Radioactivity is measured in becquerels (Bq); a million million of these is a terabecquerel (TBq).A level seven rating is defined as \"An event resulting in an environmental release corresponding to a quantity of radioactivity radiologically equivalent to a release to the atmosphere of more than several tens of thousands of TBq of Iodine-131.\"NISA puts the Fukushima figure at 370,000 TBq of Iodine-131 equivalent; the Nuclear Safety Commission, which has a more over-arching role in the Japanese system, says 630,000 TBq.Either way, it's clearly beyond the threshold for classification as an INES level seven event, although an order of magnitude lower than the 5.2 million TBq released from Chernobyl.But that tells you nothing about the danger to people.Becquerels are a measure of the rate of radioactive decay; if one atomic nucleus decays per second, that is defined as one becquerel.By contrast, sieverts - another unit commonly used during the last month's reporting - measure the likely medical impact of the radiation to which an individual is exposed.And a huge number of becquerels does not automatically translate into a huge amount of sieverts.\"It's hard to make a comparison between Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima because the radioactive release is different and so is the population,\" said John Large, a UK-based independent nuclear engineer.\"In Ukraine and Belorussia (now Belarus) it was primarily a rural population, whereas in Japan you've got a highly sophisticated public living in fairly dense population groups.\"And the way the state intervenes is different. With Chernobyl, loads of workers were brought in with no concern for their health - but Japan's a democracy.\"In some quarters, Japan's swift decision to establish an exclusion zone, initiate monitoring of people and food, and dispense iodine tablets has received praise - and the volume of advice and warnings issued to the public has been very different from the silence that pertained after Chernobyl, despite criticisms from other quarters over the quality and timing of some of the Japanese advice.Nuclear experts are cautioning, however, that the situation at Fukushima is still very much in play.Where most attention has centred on reactors 1, 2 and 3, there is also concern about the spent fuel pond in reactor building 4.In the week following the tsunami, it became clear that the pond was running dry, meaning that fuel rods would have heated up.This meant likely degradation of their zirconium alloy cladding, the possible release of hydrogen, and - by Tepco's admission - the risk that a nuclear chain reaction could begin.\"The potential for atmospheric release is very large, with 250 tonnes of material sitting in that pond,\" said Dr Large.\"If you were to have an energetic event you could have a very large release indeed.\"The priority is, as it has been all along, to restore adequate coolant to the fuel ponds and the reactors themselves -

In Northern Ireland, the figure was 46%, while in Wales, the figure was 44%.Across the English regions, recognition was highest in the North East of England - at 43%.

His father worked as a projectionist at the local Hippodrome Theatre.His interest in magic was sparked when he read a book entitled How to Entertain at Parties and he began practising tricks for his family and friends before performing in local youth clubs.There was an added bonus in that, as a small and shy child, he finally had a skill that would boost his confidence and make people take notice of him.\"From that moment,\" he later said, \"I can safely say that all I ever wanted to do in life was to become a professional magician.\"After leaving grammar school, the young Daniels found a job as a junior clerk in the treasury department of the local council.He did his national service with the Green Howards, a regiment with close connections to the north-east of England. He found himself posted to Hong Kong, where he continued to hone his skills as a magician by giving impromptu performances to fellow soldiers.After he was demobbed, he began training as an accountant before joining his parents in a small grocery business. Eventually he set up his own mobile shop.But magic remained his abiding interest and his evenings were spent performing in local variety clubs. After marrying Jacqueline Skipworth in 1960, the couple often performed together as The Eldanis, an anagram of his surname.Northern club audiences had a reputation for being somewhat unforgiving and prone to heckle performers who, in their opinion, did not come up to the mark.According to Daniels, it was abuse from one heckler in Bradford that made him come up with the retort: \"You'll like this - not a lot, but you'll like it,\" which would become his catchphrase.He developed his style of patter as a way of keeping the audience entertained and as a useful diversion when he had to perform a particularly tricky sleight of hand.His breakthrough came in 1969 when he was offered a summer season in Newquay. He sold his grocery shop and became a full-time entertainer.After an appearance on the talent show Opportunity Knocks, Daniels caught the eye of Johnny Hamp, a senior executive with Granada Television who gave him a regular slot on The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, a variety show compered by Bernard Manning and set in a fictional working men's club.In 1978, ITV gave him his own Sunday night television show and, the following year, he moved to the BBC with the Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran for 15 years.As well as performing his own tricks, Daniels had a segment of the show known as the Bunco Booth, in which he exposed the underhand methods used by street confidence tricksters. A 1985 Easter edition of his show won the prestigious Golden Rose of Montreux.By this time, he was in both a professional and personal relationship with the woman who became his on-stage assistant, the former ballerina Debbie McGee. The couple, who had first worked together during a 1979 summer season in Great Yarmouth, married in 1988.At the peak of his fame, he also hosted a number of other television series including the quiz shows Odd One Out, Every Second Counts and Wipeout, and the children's television programme Wizbit.There was controversy in 1987 when Daniels performed, on live TV, a recreation of a Harry Houdini trick in which he was chained inside a replica of a medieval iron maiden, an instrument of torture. He had to escape before the door swung fully shut to avoid being impaled on spikes.When Daniels failed to appear, the screen cut to black, giving the impression the trick had gone badly wrong. The BBC's phone lines were jammed with calls from viewers, whose concern turned to complaints when it was all revealed to be a hoax. Daniels hadn't even warned family members who had been watching.He was bitter when the BBC failed to renew his contract but continued to work in the theatre. There was a six-week run in The Magic Man in London's West End in 1994 and he created and staged special effects for hit shows such as Phantom of the Opera.He often seemed more relaxed on the stage, where he saw himself as an actor, performing what seemed to be the impossible. He preferred to describe himself as a conjuror than a magician.Daniels and his wife took part in a programme in the series When Louis Met... in which documentary maker Louis Theroux delved into the lives of celebrities with a mocking wit.He was also mercilessly lampooned on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image, in which his wig would rise up from his head and spin around on its own.McGee herself became a target of comedian Caroline Aherne's Mrs Merton character, who memorably asked her: \"What first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?\". It became one of television's most popular one-liners.Daniels was outspoken in his political views and took a strong line on law and order, once publicly offering to help Ian Huntley, convicted of the Soham schoolgirl murders, to end his own life.Three years ago at the height of the Jimmy Savile revelations he recalled being routinely offered sex earlier in his career and admitted he couldn't be sure all the women he'd slept with were over 16.He also had little truck with younger illusionists such as David Blaine, saying: \"If people were better educated in the world of magic, he would have greater difficulty than he's having. He's not very original.\"If public tastes in TV magicians had changed from Daniels' heyday in the 70s and 80s, he did not let it affect his profile on British TV.In 2004, he and McGee appeared in the Channel 5 reality TV show The Farm and, two years later, they appeared in the X Factor: Battle of the Stars.They were the first act voted off the show, after singing Let Me Entertain You by Robbie Williams.In 2010, Daniels also appeared on the eighth series of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing, where he was paired with Ola Jordan.He was the second celebrity voted off, following DJ and actor Goldie.Of his experience on the show, he told the Daily Mirror: \"It got rid of my inhibitions. That's a good thing that came out of Strictly.\"Debbie and I renewed our vows the other week and, for the first time in 22 and a half years, I danced properly with her.\"\n"," Paul Daniels brought a new dimension to the art of the stage magician, mixing complex tricks with jokes and non-stop patter.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 116 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 36.0863720536232  min ---  2165.182324886322  sec ---\n","Hawick Knitwear, which employs more than 230 staff, has also increased its production of sweaters to meet demand.Production has been boosted by better than expected sales of the Hawick Knitwear-branded range which launched in January.The company, which dates back to 1874, was bought by managing director Benny Hartop in November last year.As well as the new range, the firm has seen growth of its longer-established business of supplying customers who sell the garments under their private labels.In Europe, Hawick Knitwear sells into Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain.Markets outside Europe include the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Japan.The knitwear firm has increased its production to 9,500 sweaters each week, from about 7,500 last year, to keep up with demand.Mr Hartop said: \"The increase in production is in direct response to a surge in orders from both home and abroad for our private label clients and now for our own brand too.\"There will always be challenges but thankfully our future is looking very good and this is a testament to the dedicated staff working at all levels of the business.\"I have no doubt this success will continue for us into the future.\"\n"," A Borders textile firm has announced a 20% increase in its turnover, to Â£8m a year, in its annual accounts.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 117 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 36.325634038448335  min ---  2179.5380444526672  sec ---\n","Quite simply, if the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. If it is negative it is contracting.And two consecutive three-month periods of contraction mean an economy is in recession.GDP can be measured in three ways:In theory all three approaches should produce the same number.In the UK the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP which, apart from the first estimate, is calculated using all three ways of measuring.Usually the main interest in the UK figures is in the quarterly change in GDP in real terms, that is after taking into account changes in prices (inflation).Calculating a GDP estimate for all three measures is a huge undertaking every three months.The output measure alone - which is considered the most accurate in the short term - involves surveying tens of thousands of UK firms.The main sources used for this are ONS surveys of manufacturing and service industries.Information on sales is collected from 6,000 companies in manufacturing, 25,000 service sector firms, 5,000 retailers and 10,000 companies in the construction sector.Data is also collected from government departments covering activities such as agriculture, energy, health and education.The UK produces the earliest estimate of GDP of the major economies, around 25 days after the quarter in question.This provides policymakers with an early, or \"flash\", estimate of the real growth in economic activity. It is quick, but only based on the output measure.At that stage only about 40% of the data is available, so this figure is revised as more information comes in.They are two subsequent revisions at monthly intervals. But this isn't the end.Revisions can be made as much as 18 months to two years after the first \"flash\" estimate. The ONS publishes more information on how this is done  on its website.GDP is the principal means of determining the health of the UK economy and is used by the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as one of the key indicators in setting interest rates.So, for example, if prices are rising too fast, the Bank would be expected to increase interest rates to try to control them. But it may hold off if GDP growth is sluggish, as higher rates could damage the recovery. That is the situation at the moment.The Treasury also uses GDP when planning economic policy. When an economy is contracting, tax receipts tend to fall, and the government adjusts its tax and spending plans accordingly.UK GDP is used internationally by the various financial bodies such as OECD, IMF, and the World Bank to compare the performance of different economies.The European Union also uses GDP estimates as a basis for determining different countries' contributions to the EU budget.The information in this article was provided by the Office for National Statistics.\n"," GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is arguably the most important of all economic statistics as it attempts to capture the state of the economy in one number.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 118 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 36.695026099681854  min ---  2201.7015676498413  sec ---\n","But his killing in an air strike is a grievous strategic error - militarily insignificant but diplomatically disastrous.Towards the end of April, Nato states made a number of operational innovations. Three member states - Britain, France, and Italy - injected military advisers into rebel-held eastern Libya. Another, the US, began continuous patrols of armed drones.Third, and most important, air strikes began to target command, control, communications and intelligence networks (known, in military parlance, as C3I). The Bab al-Aziziya compound includes all three such networks, and it was presumed that their disruption would disorient regime soldiers on the front line, cut off field commanders from Tripoli, and sow confusion in the ranks.But was the strike also an assassination attempt?Assassination of a head of state is illegal under international law, and forbidden by various US presidential orders. On the other hand, the targeted killing of those woven into the enemy chain of command is shrouded in legal ambiguity.Given the personalistic nature of the regime, and the \"all means necessary\" clause in UN Resolution 1973, it might be argued that killing Col Muammar Gaddafi and certain members of his family - such as his son Khamis, commander of an elite military brigade - would be permissible, even if it posed a risk to those non-combatants around the regime.Legality, though, indicates neither legitimacy nor prudence. This strike, and the death of Saif al-Arab, have produced little military result at the greatest diplomatic and symbolic cost to Nato.Saif al-Arab was, unlike his brothers, not a senior military commander or propagandist. His death is redolent of the 1986 US strike on the same compound.That raid killed a girl who Col Gaddafi later claimed was his adopted daughter and, in the scarred buildings and craters, furnished him with a long-lasting symbol of defiance.The propaganda value of such unintended deaths is potentially severe.In the 1991 Gulf War, a US stealth bomber directed two bombs at what was claimed to be a command-and-control bunker, but was in fact an Iraqi civilian shelter.The result was 315 deaths, including 130 children. Col Gaddafi, like Saddam Hussein before him, will take every opportunity to exploit such errors to paint Western powers as indiscriminate aggressors.Moreover, this is no longer a conventional war in which top-down direction is crucial. Pro-Gaddafi forces in both the besieged western city of Misrata and in the east have adapted to Nato's air power and are using increasingly unorthodox tactics.They need not rely on a stream of detailed orders from Tripoli, and can cause considerable harm to civilians without this guidance.Nato is understandably frustrated at the diminishing returns of air strikes, since it has destroyed most accessible targets. But killing commanders and disrupting communications is far less important than the key task of degrading heavy military equipment, such as tanks and artillery.If the strike had killed Col Gaddafi himself, would it then have been at least a military success?One of the greatest mistakes of the Iraq war was assuming that, with the departure of Saddam Hussein, the state apparatus could simply be transferred to new ownership.Col Gaddafi's death could see Saif al-Islam Gaddafi take the reins, galvanise supporters, and continue the war with equal intensity. It would be dangerous and short-sighted to portray even effective assassination as a silver bullet.Perhaps, though, the demonstration to the regime that no safe haven exists, and that only capitulation would bring security, justified these risks?There is no doubt that, along with the military aim of disrupting command-and-control hubs, Nato sought a psychological effect, conscious of the possibility of \"accidental assassination\".The problem is that the direction of this effect is unclear. The dramatic visual impact of this air strike, and the death of those disconnected from political and military leadership, will harden the diplomatic opposition to the war, from Russia and China amongst others.More consequentially, it will anger the alliance's warier members, like Germany and Turkey, and inflame parts of Arab and African public opinion.It may eventually leave Britain and France bearing the military burden alone, with modest but limited assistance from a cagey US administration eager to keep at arm's length from this European war.Col Gaddafi's overarching strategy has never been to win a conventional war, but to induce symbolically prominent casualties, drive a wedge between more committed and more ambivalent members of the coalition, and knock away the pillars of political support on which this intervention was built.Thus far, the coalition had sought, rightly, to purchase coalition longevity at the price of campaign intensity. If that balance continues to shift towards the latter, Nato runs the risk of playing into the regime's hands.Shashank Joshi is an Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a defence think-tank in London, and a doctoral student of international relations at Harvard University.\n"," The death of Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, if confirmed, is likely to have come as a consequence of Nato's increasingly aggressive tactics, undertaken by the alliance to shake up a stalemate in the conflict.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 119 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 37.098768866062166  min ---  2225.9261343479156  sec ---\n","Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required.The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours.\"Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,\" an official said.Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea.This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head.After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead.â€¬The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed.

But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case.It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it.The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues.His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial.But he went on: \"It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body.\"The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\"\"If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,\" he said.US officials have given two reasons why a sea burial was chosen. First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land.According to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine.However, ABC's Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture:\"US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine.\"To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.\"\n"," US officials say Osama Bin Laden's body was treated with respect and buried at sea, but some Muslims argue there was no good reason for not burying it on land.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 120 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 37.56830997864405  min ---  2254.098600625992  sec ---\n","An ISI official told the BBC the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was killed by US forces on Sunday had been raided several years ago.But the compound \"was not on our radar\" since then, the official said.The government of Pakistan has categorically denied any knowledge of the raid before it took place.No base within Pakistan was used by US forces, the ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.It went on: \"US helicopters entered Pakistani airspace making use of blind spots in the radar coverage due to hilly terrain.\"However, the ministry defended the ISI, saying: \"As far as the target compound is concerned, ISI had been sharing information with CIA and other friendly intelligence agencies since 2009.\"Bin Laden, 54, was the founder and leader of al-Qaeda. He is believed to have ordered the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, as well as a number of other deadly bombings.The ISI official gave new details of the raid, saying Bin Laden's young daughter had said she saw her father shot.He told the BBC's Owen Bennett-Jones in Islamabad that the compound in Abbottabad, just 100km (62 miles) from the capital, was raided when under construction in 2003.It was believed an al-Qaeda operative, Abu Faraj al-Libi, was there.But since then, \"the compound was not on our radar, it is an embarrassment for the ISI\", the official said. \"We're good, but we're not God.\"He added: \"This one failure should not make us look totally incompetent.

There will be ambiguity about this and the Pakistanis will deny they had any knowledge whatsoever.The establishment here is made up of army leadership, intelligence agency leadership and some senior civil servants, and they have always run Pakistan, whether democratic governments or military governments, and those people do have connections with jihadis.The difficulty the West has is in appreciating there are more than 20 different types of jihadi organisations, and al-Qaeda is just one of them. The state has different policies towards different types of group and that subtlety is often lost on Western policy-makers.The helicopter was destroyed by the special forces unit.The US has not commented on anyone it captured or had planned to capture, other than saying it had taken Bin Laden's body.The ISI official said the organisation had recovered some documents from the compound.The CIA is already said to be going through a large number of hard drives and storage devices seized in the raid.The White House has not disclosed whether anyone has claimed the $25m (Â£15m) reward for leading the US to Bin Laden.White House counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan said there had been concern Pakistani forces would deploy to counter the US Navy Seal team conducting the raid but it had avoided any confrontation.The ISI official said: \"We were totally caught by surprise. They were in and out before we could react.\"Our correspondent says residents near the compound in Abbottabad reported that Pakistani soldiers had asked them to switch off their lights an hour before the attack, but the ISI official said this was not true and that it had no advance knowledge of the raid.Earlier, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, President Asif Ali Zardari admitted Bin Laden \"was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be\".But he denied the killing suggested Pakistan was failing in its efforts to tackle terrorism.Mr Zardari said Pakistan had \"never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media\".\"Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact,\" he said.\"Pakistan had as much reason to despise al-Qaeda as any nation. The war on terrorism is as much Pakistan's war as it is America's.\"Mr Brennan had said it was \"inconceivable that Bin Laden did not have a support system\" in Pakistan. He estimated Bin Laden had been living in the compound in Abbottabad for five or six years.Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir tried to draw a line under the matter, saying: \"Who did what is beside the point... This issue of Osama Bin Laden is history.\"Bin Laden was America's most wanted man but had eluded capture for more than a decade.US officials say that after DNA tests they are \"99.9%\" sure that the man they shot and killed and later buried at sea was Bin Laden.US President Barack Obama watched the entire operation in real time in the White House with his national security team.Mr Brennan said: \"The minutes passed like days.\"CIA director Leon Panetta narrated via a video screen from a separate Washington office, with Bin Laden given the code name Geronimo.Mr Panetta's narration lasted several minutes. \"They've reached the target...

drone strike in south Yemen on Thursday, Yemeni officials said.The attack came just days after al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US Navy Seals.The Pentagon refused to comment on the reports that Anwar al-Awlaki was specifically targeted in Yemen.According to Yemen's defence ministry, the missile fired by the drone hit a car in in the province of Shabwa carrying two brothers, identified by Yemeni officials as Musa'id and Abdullah Mubarak.But reports from Washington now suggest US commanders had believed they had one of al-Qaeda's most valuable targets in their sights.\"We were hoping it was him,\" one unnamed US official told CBS News.The reported attempt to kill Mr Awlaki is believed to be the first known US military strike within Yemen since May 2010, when missiles mistakenly killed one of Mr Saleh's envoys.In September the country's foreign minister said that such unmanned strikes had been suspended.The report comes as Yemenis continue to take to the streets to demand that Ali Abdullah Saleh, president for 30 years, step down.According to the Wall Street Journal, there were several attempts to target Mr Awlaki on Thursday.He escaped an initial attack of three rockets fired at a vehicle in which he was travelling and then swapped cars with the two brothers, who were killed in a second strike by a single drone, the newspaper said.Washington considers the Yemen-based al-Qaeda branch the world's most active terror cell.It is estimated to have some 300 fighters within Yemeni strongholds, clustered around mountain ranges where the central government has little reach.The group is said to have inspired attacks by Muslims within the US as well as plots to smuggle explosives on planes heading to the US.Some analysts are convinced that, after the death of Bin Laden, Mr Awlaki represents the greatest threat.An American-born cleric of Yemeni descent, he was placed on a terrorism blacklist in July 2010 and had imposed financial sanctions on him.US officials say Mr Awlaki helped recruit Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up an airliner as it flew into Detroit on 25 December 2009.Maj Nidal Hasan, the US Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 comrades in the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, sought religious advice from Mr Awlaki and saw him preach in the US state of Virginia in 2001, US officials say.A

more had official guest status and got a slightly closer view from inside the spaceport itself. A magnificent morning ascent for the youngest of the Nasa spaceplanes as it began its final mission - the delivery of the $2bn Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) instrument to the International Space Station.There will, however, be a group of British engineers for whom Monday's lift-off was a bitter-sweet moment. These are the people whose technology got dropped from AMS in the year before launch.For those not familiar with this story, let me back up and reprise events. They have some potentially fascinating implications for deep space travel.AMS is one of the most expensive science experiments ever put in space - probably the most expensive.It has taken a group of 600 or so researchers from 16 nations a total of 17 years to prepare it for flight. It promises some dramatic new insights into the origin and make-up of the cosmos.AMS will do this by studying the storm of high-energy particles (cosmic rays) that are hurled at Earth from the deepest reaches of the Universe.Critical to its operation is a very strong magnet. As the particles enter AMS, they will bend through this magnet. How they bend reveals their charge, a fundamental property that says a great deal about the nature of those particles and where they came from.The UK at a programmatic level never got involved in AMS, presumably because it was a space station project (and the UK doesn't engage with human spaceflight), but one British company was contracted to build the all-important magnet.Scientific Magnetics (formerly Space Cryomagnetics) of Culham, in Oxfordshire, spent 12 years developing this super-cooled beast, and it was - so the project leaders on AMS told me - a marvel.It was incredibly powerful and directed its entire field inwards, like an enclosed bubble. From the outside, the magnet appeared as an inert beer can.This was really important because if you put such a device on a shuttle or a space station and it hasn't been carefully designed, it will start to interact with its surrounding - even try to orientate itself with the Earth's magnetic field. Not what you want on a space vehicle.But to cut a long story short, the British magnet's super-fluid-helium cooling mechanism meant that it was only ever going to be a short-lived device. And when the space station's life was extended last year to 2020, the AMS project leaders took the decision to remove the UK magnet and replace it with a less powerful, but much longer-lived, Chinese one.Now, as I say, this is a story with some interesting outcomes.The British magnet is currently sitting in store at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) where AMS was assembled and tested, and there's a lot of interest in seeing its technology put to other uses.The first of these is astronaut protection. The cosmic rays that AMS is trying to characterise are particles that also represent a hazard to humans in space.When astronauts eventually go beyond the space station - back to the Moon, and on to asteroids and Mars - they will need to shield themselves from these high-energy particles. The idea of using a powerful magnetic field to do this job is being investigated Dr Roberto Battiston, the deputy principal investigator on AMS. He told me:\"We continue to work to understand how this technology could be used for future shielding of astronauts undergoing long exposure, for instance at a Moonbase or on a trip to Marsâ€¦ because this is by far the most advanced super-conducting magnet-design ever built and completed for a space mission. It is not going to fly but it had everything that would allow it to fly.\"The European Space Agency asked me to submit a proposal for a feasibility study and [Scientific Magnetics] is part of it.\"We would design the magnet in a different way to the AMS one.  AMS was designed to have a very strong magnetic field within an inner bore. By modifying the coils and the currents, we can design a magnetic field confined in an external ring surrounding an inner bore that is magnetic-field free. In this internal module will be the habitable part for the astronauts - where they will live. We are talking about something having a diameter of about five to six metres and the length of 10m - surrounded by this magnetic field that is intense enough to bend away cosmic rays coming from deep space.\"There are immense practicalities to overcome, of course. These special magnets get their strength because they are superconducting. This means running them at cryo-temperatures, which demands a lot of liquid helium.This has a tendency to boil off over time, limiting the life of your device, which brings us back to AMS. All that said, Professor Battiston is encouraged by the research. He says it should be possible to limit radiation exposure on a Mars flight to something similar to that currently experienced by astronauts on a six-month stay at the space station.The other big space application for which British magnet technology might be useful is in the plasma rockets that could one day propel all spacecraft.These rely on the motion of highly excited gases, or plasmas, moulded by magnetic fields to provide thrust. Although they don't give the initial big kick you get from chemical combustion, their supreme efficiency means they can go on thrusting for extended periods, achieving far more acceleration per kilogram of fuel consumed. Proponents of plasma rockets say they could dramatically cut the journey time to Mars from months to weeks.Scientific Magnetics has already produced a superconducting magnet for a testbed at Ad Astra in Texas, the company at the forefront of this propulsion technology.Steve Harrison from Scientific Magnetics told me:\"These rockets use radio frequency heating to generate the plasma and then the magnets contain the plasma in the same way they do in a tokomak fusion reactor. The magnets are profiled such that they form a sort of nozzle out the back; and because the plasma is expanding and supersonic, it flies out and gives you thrust. For the system Ad Astra has been testing for the last two years, we designed and built the super-conducting magnet.\"Similar obstacles to the magnetic shield prevent immediate adoption of the propulsion application as well, especially if the propulsion magnets incorporate cryogenic liquids, but both concepts are definitely worth watching for the future.\n"," It's thought as many as half a million people crammed the roads and beaches outside the Kennedy Space Center to see Endeavour's final launch.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 126 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 39.59988644123077  min ---  2375.9931886196136  sec ---\n","The dramatic creation by Philip Treacy has been likened to a Turkey Twizzler, a lavatory seat and a pretzel.The 22-year-old princess wore it to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton last month, and a Facebook page was set up in its honour.The auction on eBay ended on Sunday, with the proceeds going to charities Unicef and Children in Crisis.The identity of the winning bidder has not yet been revealed.The princess commented on the auction page: \"I've been amazed by the amount of attention the hat has attracted.\"It's a wonderful opportunity to raise as much money as possible for two fantastic charities.\"I hope whoever wins the auction has as much fun with the hat as I have.\"\n"," Princess Beatrice's royal wedding hat has been sold on auction site eBay for £81,100.01.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 127 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 39.883504486083986  min ---  2393.0102713108063  sec ---\n","More than 1,000 tombs and 3,000 ancient settlements were also revealed by looking at infra-red images which show up underground buildings.Initial excavations have already confirmed some of the findings, including two suspected pyramids.The work has been pioneered at the University of Alabama at Birmingham by US Egyptologist Dr Sarah Parcak.She says she was amazed at how much she and her team has found.\"We were very intensely doing this research for over a year. I could see the data as it was emerging, but for me the \"Aha!\" moment was when I could step back and look at everything that we'd found and I couldn't believe we could locate so many sites all over Egypt.\"To excavate a pyramid is the dream of every archaeologist,\" she said.The team analysed images from satellites orbiting 700km above the earth, equipped with cameras so powerful they can pin-point objects less than 1m in diameter on the earth's surface.Infra-red imaging was used to highlight different materials under the surface.Ancient Egyptians built their houses and structures out of mud brick, which is much denser than the soil that surrounds it, so the shapes of houses, temples and tombs can be seen.\"It just shows us how easy it is to underestimate both the size and scale of past human settlements,\" says Dr Parcak.And she believes there are more antiquities to be discovered:\"These are just the sites [close to] the surface. There are many thousands of additional sites that the Nile has covered over with silt. This is just the beginning of this kind of work.\"BBC cameras followed Dr Parcak on her \"nervous\" journey when she travelled to Egypt to see if excavations could back up what her technology could see under the surface.In the BBC documentary Egypt's Lost Cities, they visit an area of Saqqara (Sakkara) where the authorities were not initially interested in her findings.But after being told by Dr Parcak that she had seen two potential pyramids, they made test excavations, and they now believe it is one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt.But Dr Parcak said the most exciting moment was visiting the excavations at Tanis.\"They'd excavated a 3,000-year-old house that the satellite imagery had shown and the outline of the structure matched the satellite imagery almost perfectly. That was real validation of the technology.\"The Egyptian authorities plan to use the technology to help - among other things - protect the country's antiquities in the future.During the recent revolution, looters accessed some well-known archaeological sites.\"We can tell from the imagery a tomb was looted from a particular period of time and we can alert Interpol to watch out for antiquities from that time that may be offered for sale.\"She also hopes the new technology will help engage young people in science and will be a major help for archaeologists around the world.\"It allows us to be more focused and selective in the work we do.

But some advanced theories of physics speculate that it's not round, and so what we've done is designed an experiment to check with a very, very high degree of precision,\" said lead author Jony Hudson, from Imperial.The current best theory to explain the interactions of sub-atomic particles is known as the Standard Model. According to this framework, the electron should be close to perfectly spherical.But the Standard Model is incomplete. It does not explain how gravity works and fails to explain other phenomena observed in the Universe.So physicists have tried to build on this model. One framework to explain physics beyond the Standard Model is known as supersymmetry.However, this theory predicts that the electron has a more distorted shape than that suggested by the Standard Model. According to this idea, the particle could be egg-shaped.Researchers stress that the new observation does not rule out super-symmetry. But it does not support the theory, according to Dr Hudson.He hopes to improve the accuracy of his measurements four-fold within five years. By then, he said, his team might be able to make a definitive statement about supersymmetry and some other theories to explain physics beyond the Standard Model.\"We'd then be in a position to say supersymmetry is right because we have seen a distorted electron or supersymmetry has got to be wrong because we haven't,\" he told BBC News.Dr Hudson's measurement is twice as precise as the previous efforts to elucidate the shape of the electron.That in itself does not alter scientists' understanding of sub-atomic physics, according to Professor Aaron Leanhardt of the Unviersity of Michigan in the US.But the prospect of improved measurements and the potential to shed light on current theories of particle physics has made the research community \"sit up and take notice\".\"A factor of two doesn't change the physics community's general opinion of what's going on,\" he told BBC News.But he added that improved measurements could start \"constraining the possible theories, and what could be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider at Cern and what you might expect in cosmological observations.\"Current theories also suggest that if the electron is more or less round, then there ought to be equal amounts of matter and anti-matter - which, as its name suggests, is the opposite of matter.Instead, astronomers have observed a Universe made up largely of matter. But that is an observation that could be explained if the electron were found to be more egg-shaped than the Standard Model predicts.Although the shape of the electron could have an important bearing on the future theories of particle physics, Dr Hudson's main motivation is simply curiosity.\"We really should know what the shape of the electron is,\" he said.\"It's one of the basic building blocks of matter and if this isn't what physicists do I don't know what we should do\".\n"," The most accurate measurement yet of the shape of the electron has shown it to be almost perfectly spherical.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 129 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 40.40044622818629  min ---  2424.026775598526  sec ---\n","It was scrapped this week at the eleventh hour when the government removed it from parliament moments before it was due to be voted into law.Under the proposal, which had already passed a first round of voting, it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could \"destroy, alter or subvert state institutions\" or \"damage national integrity or independence\".This would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook, or receiving an email containing anti-government sentiment, could have faced up to 12 years in prison.The law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos, pictures or recordings without the subject's consent, criminalise \"whistle-blowing\" under the crime of \"espionage\" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state, even if it was not classified.Minister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital, Luanda, that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision.But many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists, who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was \"totalitarian\" and violated basic freedom of expression, played a role in the decision to abandon the law.US-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have \"undercut both freedom of expression and information, and posed a severe threat to independent media, whistle-blowers, and investigative journalism\".With most of Angola's traditional media controlled by the state, or owned by government ministers and their business associates, there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio.Opposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time, while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin.Civil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet, even though only 1% of Angolans have access to the web, to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites.In recent months, several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook, where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public.Angolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium.Many are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity.The introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest.In an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to \"insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion\".Officially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud.The editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal.\"The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed,\" she told the BBC.Sizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down.\"This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across.\" she said.However, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda.Organised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime.But following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square.According to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests.They were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people.A spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted \"criminally\" and the police force was within its rights to respond.\"What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate,\" Ms Cutaia said.Although small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA.\"The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations,\" Ms Cutaia says.\"All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change.\"Most of all they want the right to be able to make their voices heard.\"\n"," In a rare climbdown, the Angolan government has withdrawn controversial legislation severely restricting how people use the internet.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 130 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 40.911502905686696  min ---  2454.6901762485504  sec ---\n","Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months.It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume.A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a \"similar location and mechanism\", the BSG said.Shale gas drilling, known as \"fracking\", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions.Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: \"We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.\"We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that.\"The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite.But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice.The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution.

Minister Christine Lagarde has been described as having a rock-star appeal on the international political circuit.By contrast, Mexico's central bank governor Agustin Carstens, is known for his rotund figure, which is often portrayed in Mexican political cartoons.But Mr Carstens, 53, is by no means a joke candidate in the race to lead the IMF.His economic credentials cannot be doubted.He graduated with an economics degree from the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, before collecting both a master's and PhD in economics from the University of Chicago, where deregulation and \"laissez-faire\" economics were the dominant views.It was there that Mr Carstens, a former Little League baseball star, became a fan of the Chicago Cubs team.It was also in Chicago that Mr Carstens met his wife, economist and author Catherine Mansell, who writes under the pen name CM Mayo.After obtaining his doctorate in 1985, Mr Carstens returned to Mexico where he joined the central bank and rose through the ranks, his roles including chief of staff in the governor's office and director general of economic research.While at the bank, he gained first-hand experience of dealing with financial crises, including Mexico's debt problems in the 1980s and the peso's crash in 1994 - experience which his supporters say make him the ideal candidate for the IMF.He left the bank in 1999 to work as an executive director at the IMF, but returned to Mexico in 2000, serving as deputy finance minister under President Vicente Fox, marking his first ties with the conservative National Action Party.In 2003, he rejoined the IMF as deputy managing director, where he was held in high regard.When he left the role in 2006, again to return to front-line Mexican politics, Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF President at the time, described him as \"a superb ambassador for the fund, who carried high credibility with policymakers\".Serving as finance minister for three years under President Felipe Calderon, Mr Carstens was responsible for pushing through new taxes to bolster Mexico's revenues.But his biggest gaffe came in early 2009 when a reporter asked him if the economic troubles in the US would affect Mexico.The reporter reminded him of the saying that when the US catches a cold, Mexico usually catches pneumonia.Mexico's economy was in good health at the time and Mr Carstens replied the country would only get \"the sniffles\".In fact, Mexico's economic output fell by 6.5% that year.Nevertheless, sniffles aside, President Calderon nominated Mr Carstens to be the next head of the Bank of Mexico, a post he has held for the past year and a half.But his pledge to work closely with the government raised questions about the bank's independence.\"Being autonomous on monetary policy does not mean you have to be isolated from the national economic debate,\" he said at his confirmation hearing.Mr Carstens himself acknowledges Ms Lagarde is the favourite to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the IMF.\"I'm not fooling myself. It's like starting a soccer game with a 5-0 score,\" he said on Monday.He says he would bring \"a fresh pair of eyes\" to the role.A European, he says, could face a conflict of interest, given the continuing debt crisis in some eurozone countries, while he can appreciate what emerging markets can contribute to the IMF.But the fact he is from the Americas could work against him.Robert Zoellick, from the US, currently heads the World Bank and some countries may not be keen to see the two global institutions led by officials from the same part of the world.Traditionally, an American has headed the World Bank while a European has been in charge of the IMF.And while Mr Carstens has the support of most of Latin America, Brazil - the region's largest economy - has yet to say whom it will back.For Mr Carstens to be successful, he would almost certainly need Brazil to back him.\n"," The two candidates competing to be the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

Labour AM for Mid and West Wales, backs a fingerprint ID system of cashless payments to help poorer children.She is due to launch a debate on the issue in the Senedd on Tuesday and says some pupils are going hungry to avoid being seen to claim free meals.She says there is a mixed picture on the use of cashless payment systems.Her office's research indicates that in Denbighshire, for example, all secondary schools use some sort of cashless system, whereas in Anglesey none do.Most commonly, in schools where children still pay with cash for their dinners, pupils eligible for free meals are given tickets.The AM believes this makes it easy for such children to be identified and put at risk of bullying.She recommends rolling out a system by which children have accounts to pay for school dinners which can be topped up either by their parents or by the local authority if they qualify for school meals.All pupils would then pay for their meals by a biometric reading of their fingerprint at the till without anyone knowing how their account was funded.Ms Watson said: \"68% is the average take up of free school meals where we have a system that identifies against a near 100% where we have a system that doesn't identify those who have free school meals and those who don't.She claimed that in schools without a cashless system there were \"an awful lot of children simply going hungry\" to avoid being seen to have free meals.\"[They] can't concentrate.

In other words, armies control the \"supply-side\" of revolution.History is replete with abortive awakenings, in which the supply constraint has choked off change: Europe 1848, Hungary 1956, Prague 1968, Beijing 1989, and - what may turn into the tragic footnote to the Arab Spring - Bahrain 2011. Syria could be appended to that list in short order.This is about much more than raw coercive capacity. Both South Korea's army in 1987 and Egypt's this year could have put up stiff resistance to the movements that swept away incumbent dictators. Why did they hold their fire?The answer lies in civil-military dynamics. Armies that have their own identity, that possess a corporate existence separate from their political masters, often choose to manage political transition rather than simply squelch it. They see a future beyond the regime.In Turkey, Pakistan, and now Egypt, the army has judged that it can enjoy its economic and political privileges by controlling the scope and direction of change.In fact, outright repression would tarnish the invaluable national credentials each institution enjoys, largely as a result of its own myth-making and manipulation.Egypt's army did try to dislodge the masses in Tahrir Square. But when it realised it could not do so without enormous bloodshed that would also wash away the institution's veneer, it shied away.On the other hand, armies that are little more than outgrowths of an autocratic regime know that they have no institutional future if protesters get their way.In Syria, 70% of career soldiers and 80% of officers are drawn from the ruling minority Alawite clan. Those units employed in crackdowns and massacres, such as the Fourth Division controlled by President Bashar al-Assad's brother, are all-Alawite, as are key intelligence organisations and militias.These armies - like Bahrain's security forces and Libya's elite brigades - may be disciplined and cohesive, but they are not professional. Since their fate is bound up with that of the regimes, they have little compunction in unleashing violence.It is this distinction, between independent and servile armies, that is one of the most important parameters in determining the trajectory of an uprising.An independent, professional army, no matter how powerful, will have appealing alternatives to bloodshed. That doesn't guarantee a democratic revolution - see the sorry paths of 1980s Turkey or 1990s Pakistan - but it does enable a change.Armies with a distinct corporate identity can produce dangerous Praetorian states - where the military exercises undue influence over the political regime - but they can also enable peaceful transitions.For those armies that opt for violence, capacity does matter. The archetypal case remains Tiananmen Square. Even though 3,500 PLA officers disobeyed orders in 1989, this was only a fraction of the overall total used in the crackdown.It helped that the PLA's 27th Army was at the forefront; this unit's troops were from northern Shaanxi Province, speaking a different dialect to the student protesters.Bahrain learnt this lesson well, and spent years importing Sunni mercenaries from Pakistan. They have proved to be ready to fire on Shia protesters.The Iraqi army, a mostly Sunni force, had similarly little compunction about brutally putting down the 1991 uprising in Shia and Kurdish parts of the country.In Syria, the Assad regime cynically uses Christian and Druze troops against Sunni targets.The UAE has gone a step further, reportedly hiring Blackwater founder Erik Prince to help establish an all-mercenary force of about 800 foreign fighters.Ethnic difference matters.Nonetheless, most armies do not enjoy the Tiananmen option. A weak army, or one where only select units are equipped and led by regime loyalists, will quickly disintegrate into patchwork militias.In Libya, eastern units peeled away from Gaddafi at the outset of the conflict, sowing the seeds of a civil war. What could have been another Hama - the 1982 massacre perpetrated by an earlier incarnation of the Assad regime in Syria - became something much less simple.All of this is not to neglect the demand-side of revolution. After all, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have all been largely quiet, and not just because of fear.But with the understandable romanticisation of raw protest, we lose sight of the fact that massed crowds are but one ingredient of successful regime change.For those peering into these restive states, this is a reminder that capacity-building in the absence of professionalisation simply produces more efficient slaughter.Britain trained and equipped some of the Libyan special forces who inflicted such horrors on cities like Misrata. Western states continue to train Saudi forces, and this may well have much the same effect.For those that find this improbable, consider that six months ago Bahrain was considered a humane and liberalising country whose parliamentary institutions obviated the need for a crackdown.The more immediate lessons may be these: parts of Yemen's splintered forces have proven flexible enough to manoeuvre away from the Saleh regime, and might yet fall in line behind a transitional government that emerges.Syria's sectarian army, on the other hand, will not go down without a fierce fight - one that they have an excellent chance of winning.Shashank Joshi is an Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a defence think-tank in London, and a doctoral student of international relations at Harvard University.\n"," In the wave of dissent sweeping over the Arab world, an old lesson is being re-learnt: that armies are the key to unlocking a revolution's potential.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 151 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 47.336691959698996  min ---  2840.2015194892883  sec ---\n","\"Welcome to Canada - honeymoon capital of the Commonwealth,\" David Johnston said before crowds at Government House.Prince William, who began his address in French, Canada's official language alongside English, said he and his wife had had a \"longing\" to visit together.The duke and duchess earlier visited Canada's National War Memorial.The couple will be staying at Government House - also known as Rideau Hall - while in Ottawa.Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke after the governor general, saying: \"Your journey across our fair Dominion marks the beginning of your journey into the hearts of Canadians.

The surgeons stress a windpipe can also be made within days.The 36-year-old cancer patient is doing well a month after the operation.Professor Paolo Macchiarini from Italy led the pioneering surgery, which took place at the Karolinska University Hospital.In an interview with the BBC, he said he now hopes to use the technique to treat a nine-month-old child in Korea who was born with a malformed windpipe or trachea.Professor Macchiarini already has 10 other windpipe transplants under his belt - most notably the world's first tissue-engineered tracheal transplant in 2008 on 30-year-old Spanish woman Claudia Costillo - but all required a donor.The key to the latest technique is modelling a structure or scaffold that is an exact replica of the patient's own windpipe, removing the need for a donor organ.To do this he enlisted the help of UK experts who were given 3D scans of the 36-year-old African patient, Andemariam Teklesenbet Beyene. The geology student currently lives in Iceland where he is studying for a PhD.Using these images, the scientists at University College London were able to craft a perfect copy of Mr Beyene's trachea and two main bronchi out of glass.This was then flown to Sweden and soaked in a solution of stem cells taken from the patient's bone marrow.After two days, the millions of holes in the porous windpipe had been seeded with the patient's own tissue.Dr Alex Seifalian and his team used this fragile structure to create a replacement for the patient, whose own windpipe was ravaged by an inoperable tumour.Despite aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the cancer had grown to the size of a golf ball and was blocking his breathing. Without a transplant he would have died.During a 12-hour operation Professor Macchiarini removed all of the tumour and the diseased windpipe and replaced it with the tailor-made replica.The bone marrow cells and lining cells taken from his nose, which were also implanted during the operation, were able to divide and grow, turning the inert windpipe scaffold into an organ indistinguishable from a normal healthy one.And, importantly, Mr Beyene's body will accept it as its own, meaning he will not need to take the strong anti-rejection drugs that other transplant patients have to.Professor Macchiarini said this was the real breakthrough.\"Thanks to nanotechnology, this new branch of regenerative medicine, we are now able to produce a custom-made windpipe within two days or one week.\"This is a synthetic windpipe. The beauty of this is you can have it immediately. There is no delay. This technique does not rely on a human donation.\"He said many other organs could be repaired or replaced in the same way.A month on from his operation, Mr Beyene is still looking weak, but well.Sitting up in his hospital bed, he said: \"I was very scared, very scared about the operation. But it was live or die.\"He says he is looking forward to getting back to Iceland to finish his studies and then returning to his home in Eritrea where he will be reunited with his wife and young family, and meet his new three-month-old child.He says he is eternally grateful to the medical team that has saved his life.\n"," Surgeons in Sweden have carried out the world's first synthetic organ transplant.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 155 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 48.89464413324992  min ---  2933.678650379181  sec ---\n","Up until 1994 it was ruled by a white minority which enforced a separation of races with its policy called apartheid.The apartheid government eventually negotiated itself out of power after decades of international isolation, armed opposition and mass protests.The democratically-elected leadership encouraged reconciliation and set about redressing social imbalances.Population 50.7 millionArea 1.22 million sq km (470,693 sq miles)Major languages 11 official languages including English, Afrikaans, Sesotho, Setswana, Xhosa and ZuluReligions Christianity, Islam, indigenous beliefsLife expectancy 53 years (men), 54 years (women)Currency RandPresident: Jacob ZumaThe leader of the ruling African National Congress party, Jacob Zuma, was chosen president by the newly-elected parliament in May 2009.He has spent his entire adult life since 1959 in the service of the ANC.

Even as they did that, eyewitnesses say, the gunman opened fire on them.The chatter now is that it took the police an hour, if not an hour and a half, to actually get to the island. Of course that gave the gunman so much time to kill so many people.Also crucially, the police were throwing all their resources at the huge bomb attack which had just taken place in the centre of Oslo.But still, the question will be asked: Were there not police nearer to this area who could have moved in much more quickly?Local media report that police are investigating claims by witnesses that a second person was involved, apparently not disguised in a police uniform.A farm supply firm has confirmed selling six tonnes of fertiliser to Mr Breivik who is reported to have run a farming company. Speculation has been rife that fertiliser could have been used in the Oslo bomb.The number killed in the island shooting spree, which is among the world's most deadly, had been put at 10 on Friday - but soared overnight. Hundreds of young people had been attending the summer camp organised by the governing Labour Party on Utoeya island.Eyewitnesses described how a tall, blond man dressed as a policeman opened fire indiscriminately, prompting camp attendees to jump into the water to try to escape the hail of bullets.Some of the teenagers were shot at as they tried to swim to safety.Armed police were deployed to the island but details of the operation to capture the suspect remain unclear. After his arrest he was charged with committing acts of terrorism.Profile: Anders Behring BreivikPolice say they discovered many more victims after searching the area around the island. They have warned the death toll may rise further as rescue teams continue to scour the waters around the island.The gunman is reported to have been armed with a handgun, an automatic weapon and a shotgun.\"He travelled on the ferry boat from the mainland over to that little inland island posing as a police officer, saying he was there to do research in connection with the bomb blasts,\" NRK journalist Ole Torp told the BBC.\"He asked people to gather round and then he started shooting, so these young people fled into the bushes and woods and some even swam off the island to get to safety.\"One 15-year-old eyewitness described how she saw what she thought was a police officer open fire.\"He first shot people on the island.

That's not right.\"What I'm trying to do is get Parliament to discuss this issue between what Parliament wants and what the people want.\"House of Commons leader Sir George Young has warned that it would damage democracy to ignore strong opinions among members of the public \"or pretend that their views do not exist\".Douglas Carswell MP agreed, saying, although he was firmly against the death penalty, he was in favour of Parliament debating it and would support a referendum on whether it should be brought back.\"I'm convinced that if there was a referendum on capital punishment we could win it; we could get most people to say 'no' to the death penalty.\"We need to treat people as grown-ups and have the debate and not do what we have done for half a century which is to ignore the public's concern and treat them with contempt.\"The important thing is we have this debate.\"Mr Carswell added that the reason why Parliament had not debated this topic in recent years was because it was \"out of touch with the public\".\"The mistake MPs have made is to not trust the people and to try and ignore their concerns. We can disagree with it but we have to trust it.\"But Neil Durkin from Amnesty International said it was a \"waste of time and money that we as a nation cannot afford\".In September 2010, YouGov conducted the last opinion poll to ask directly if people want the death penalty re-instated. It suggested that 51% did.And a Mori poll in July 2010 asked people which of a list of crimes they thought should have the death penalty.For child murder, 62% supported it while a YouGov poll in November 2010 found 74% of people supported the death penalty for murder in some circumstances, though only 16% supported it for all murders.However, when similar polls were carried out in the 1970s, support for it was far higher with 70% in favour.Anthony Wells, associate director of YouGov, says polls which ask about the death penalty are straightforward: \"Do you support it or not?\"\"When people already know about it and have established views then it is quite simple. The hard ones [opinion polls] are when people need to have an issue explained to them.\"He said historically opinion polls on capital punishment have been commissioned by newspapers when there has been a heinous crime such as after the Soham murders.Mr Wells added that such polls are not often commissioned in times when a high-profile murder is not in the news. However, the last two polls on the subject were not about a specific case, being conducted for a story about sentencing for murder and for a Channel 4 programme.Polls are quite accurate, plus or minus 3%, said Mr Wells, and their accuracy can be checked against real life events such as who is going to win the election or X Factor.\"All the polls about the death penalty show similar patterns so even if it was worded differently it would still get the same result,\" he added.\"You can only tell what people think at the moment, but if it follows current trends then yes, I'd expect it to go down.\"Mr Durkin from Amnesty International said it was important to have an informed debate, rather than a simple \"yes or no\" question.\"Public opinion polls are usually conducted after a particularly horrible murder that's had lots of publicity so you do tend to get that outcry.\"On top of that, when we have looked at opinion polls in the US, most people tend to think that the US is firmly in terms of public opinion pro death penalty.\"If you offer in those questions to the public alternatives to capital punishment - the lethal injections, the electrocutions, whatever it is - and talk about longer sentences then support drops away.\"\n"," An internet campaign has reignited the debate on whether the UK government should seek the reintroduction of the death penalty.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 171 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 53.95237352450689  min ---  3237.142413854599  sec ---\n","More than 100 people have been arrested as officers were attacked, police vehicles damaged and shops looted.Disorder spread to Enfield, Walthamstow and Waltham Forest in north London and to Brixton in the south of the city.Home Secretary Teresa May has cut short her holiday to return to the UK following the disorder.Some 35 officers have been injured over the two nights of rioting.Three officers were hurt when a vehicle hit them as they tried to make an arrest in Waltham Forest, east London.Clashes broke out in Enfield, north London, on Sunday evening where shop windows were smashed and a police car damaged.There have been reports of a gang of up to 200 youths looting shops and charging police in Coldharbour Lane and the High Street in Brixton, south London.Metropolitan Police Commander Adrian Hanstock said: \"This is not groups of people acting on behalf of communities or with any consent.\"This is individuals who are actually attacking communities, businesses, properties and houses and actually causing a huge amount of upset and criminality.\"The Met said it had dealt with several incidents of \"copycat criminal activity\" across the city.These included:Kit Malthouse, Deputy Mayor of London and Chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, described the scenes of the last two nights as \"disgusting and shocking\" and said the police did a good job.He added: \"Obviously there are people in this city, sadly, who are intent on violence, who are looking for the opportunity to steal and set fire to buildings and create a sense of mayhem, whether they're anarchists or part of organised gangs or just feral youth frankly, who fancy a new pair of trainers.\"Talking about the impact on the capital's image, one year ahead of the Olympic Games, he said: \"It's pretty rotten for London, it does not look good.\"What we need to do over the next few months is to underline to people the fundamental truth about London which is that it is one of the safest, great big cities on earth.\"We have a low murder rate and this kind of violence is very rare.\"The Home Secretary, Theresa May said: \"Last night, police officers again put themselves in harm's way to protect Londoners and their property.\"Londoners have made clear that there are no excuses for violence, and I call on all members of local communities to work constructively with the police to help them bring these criminals to justice.\"BBC London's Paraic O'Brien said he had witnessed widespread looting in Brixton.He said: \"They smashed a William Hill, they set bins on fire.\"And now what we're seeing as the night progresses is that replicated, sort of flashpoints all along Brixton High Street.By Andy MooreBBC NewsI saw the rioting in Tottenham on Saturday and I saw the rioting last night and it was certainly different in character.What might have been started in Tottenham by youngsters aggrieved about what they saw as police persecution has become something very different in nature.Last night there was a sense that the looting, and violence and disorder across London was being co-ordinated on social media.There were people in their cars, youngsters on bicycles, moving very rapidly, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. As soon as you moved to one location they would move on to the next one.The police were doing their best to catch up with them. You had police vehicles going backwards and forwards, blue lights flashing, riot police coming out of their vehicles.Ten minutes later they'd get back in again and go off to the next location - essentially trying to fight the fires, metaphorically, that were spreading all over London.\"I'm standing outside Halfords on the other side of the road and they've just smashed through the doors of Halfords. They're taking bikes out the front entrance.\"I have to say, what really struck me was the small number of police officers that there actually seem to be on Brixton High Street responding to this.\"Press Association photographer Lewis Whyld saw looters battle police at a Currys store in Brixton.He said: \"A couple of hundred youths were rioting and looting. Riot police went in to get them out and there was a big fight in the street.\"Youths were throwing rocks and bottles and there was a bin on fire. They used a fire extinguisher to push the police back so they could get back into Currys and continue taking things out.\"Met Police Commander Christine Jones said: \"Officers are shocked at the outrageous level of violence directed against them.\"At least nine officers were injured overnight in addition to the 26 injured on Saturday night.\"London Fire Brigade said it had been called to a number of fires in Enfield, Brixton and Walthamstow, including a fire at a shop on Brixton Road, which is now under control.The disorder follows rioting in Tottenham which broke out on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning.A peaceful protest over the fatal shooting by police on Thursday of 29-year-old Mark Duggan descended into violence later in the evening.The unrest spread into nearby Wood Green and Tottenham Hale.Shops were attacked and looted, 26 police officers and three others were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.Tottenham Hotspur Football Club's ticket office was also damaged during the violence.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that there were too few officers in Tottenham on Saturday night, but blamed Twitter for fuelling looting and violence, saying: \"Social media and other methods have been used to organise these levels of greed and criminality.\"Mr Kavanagh pledged that more officers would be on London's streets on Monday night to prevent or tackle further outbreaks.Parts of Tottenham are still cordoned off, as officers and forensic specialists continue to examine the riot scene.A total of 61 arrests have been made in connection with the first night of rioting. The majority were for burglary, and other offences including violent disorder, robbery, theft and handling stolen goods.Sixteen people have been charged for offences including burglary, violent disorder and possession of a pointed or bladed weapon following the Tottenham riots.As well as Mr Duggan, a police officer was also shot in Thursday's incident, which happened in what was called a \"pre-planned\" event, under Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime in London's African and Caribbean communities.Police had stopped a minicab which Mr Duggan had been travelling in.The violence has also affected public transport and the roads.

it really depends on what you want.With its roomy, minimalist cabin and a square body, which many say only looks better once it has had a few knocks, the current Defender is obviously better suited as a serious workhorse.But for the fashion-conscious who prefer a more comfortable ride and a lavishly fitted out interior, the Evoque might be a better bet.The same may well be true for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK-based Tata Motors subsidiary that hopes to boost the profits it makes from both Range Rover and Land Rover vehicles.Land Rover is eager to conquer new markets at a time when competent rivals are enjoying great success in attracting farmers, workers and soldiers, offering them working vehicles that are often both better and cheaper than the Defender.Land Rover's global brand director, John Edwards, is hopeful the Evoque's lightweight construction and relatively low fuel consumption and emissions make it well suited to the job.\"This car will be our best-selling model,\" he says in an interview with BBC News, predicting that it will outsell Land Rover's Freelander, Discovery and Defender models, as well as the full-size Range Rover and Range Rover Sport.\"The sports utility vehicle (SUV) market is growing, but downsizing, and the premium market is growing in general,\" he observes. \"This meets those two trends quite well.\"Crowned Car of the Year 2011 by Auto Express, the Evoque is expected to broaden Land Rover's customer base.About half the buyers of the compact Evoque SUV are expected to be women, compared with just a quarter of Land Rover's current customers, and it is also expected to appear to a younger audience.Many of them will probably opt for a cheaper and more frugal two-wheel-drive version, rather than one kitted out with four-wheel-drive.Moreover, some 80% of the Evoques, which will be made at Land Rover's Halewood factory, will be sold abroad.\"We intend it to be a global car,\" Mr Edwards says.But the Evoque is more than just a response to the market, according to Land Rover's managing director, Colin Green.\"With previous cars like the Freelander and Discovery, we've been looking at emerging segments, whereas with the Evoque we're trying to identify 'white space',\" he tells BBC News in an interview.\"The design has led the package, rather than the functionality leading the design.\"That seems to be a major change in philosophy for Land Rover, which has traditionally been one of the most pragmatic, problem-solving companies in the motor industry.It is also a strategy that is changing the company's makeup, with its upmarket Range Rover models destined to outshine its Land Rover models.\"I think Range Rover will make up more than 50% of sales by 2030,\" Mr Green says.This might suggest a shift away from the company's core offroad values.But Mr Edwards is eager to stress that the Evoque is \"just as capable, if not more capable on some surfaces, than some of our other models\".\"They offer luxury, plus the Land Rover capability,\" he says.Driving the Evoque on rutted tracks in Snowdonia makes it clear that the company's smaller, cheaper Range Rover is not a soft-roader. It is a perfectly able offroad vehicle, even when faced with fairly serious challenges.And with most of its offroad capabilities controlled by electronics, such as an adaptive damping system, it is also much smoother in the rough, with little room for human error by the button-pressing iPad generation that is expected to be buying it.That prompts the question: redesign or no redesign, is the Defender quite simply obsolete?\"It's very long in the tooth,\" acknowledges Mr Edwards, though he nevertheless insists the Defender remains relevant.\"It's very important that we don't forget Land Rover and its capability. We are working very hard on the non-Range Rover badge products in our range.\"Replacing [the Defender] is going to be quite a challenge, but also an opportunity,\" says Mr Edwards. \"But we're definitely doing it.\"We'll want to replace the car as it currently occupies the market. We certainly don't want to move it upmarket and become a sort of 'Range Rover Defender'. That doesn't work at all.\"\"One of our problems in the past looking to replace the Defender has been to get the business case together,\" observes managing director Mr Green. \"Military contracts are fine, but you might get 5,000 orders one year, 200 the next.\"A more promising market might be in developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, where working vehicle sales are booming in parallel with rapid economic growth that is predicted to continue for decades yet.To succeed in these markets, a new Defender will need to be able to compete on both price and quality. It will  need to be both cheaper - so the cost of production will need to come down - and better, in terms of both capabilities and fuel economy.And that may well prove an even trickier challenge than the creation of an urban warrior with designer looks.\n"," The Land Rover Defender has become an automotive icon, remaining largely unchanged since the first Land Rover was introduced in 1948, before going on to enjoy sales of more than two million around the world.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 175 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 55.33525579373042  min ---  3320.1153495311737  sec ---\n","1913 - Britain and the Ottoman government sign a treaty recognising the independence of Bahrain but the country remains under British administration.Manama is a major port city, commercial centre1931 - The Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco), a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California (Socal), discovers oil at Jabal al-Dukhan and production begins the following year.1939 - Britain decides that the Hawar Islands which lie in the Gulf of Bahrain between Bahrain and Qatar belong to Bahrain not Qatar.1961 - Sheikh Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah becomes ruler of Bahrain.1967 - Britain moves its main regional naval base from Aden to Bahrain.1968 - Britain announces it will close its bases east of Suez by 1971.1970 - The Administrative Council becomes a 12-member Council of State, headed by a president, the ruler's brother, Sheikh Khalifah Bin-Salman Al Khalifah.1970 May - Iran renounces its claim to sovereignty over Bahrain after a United Nations report shows that Bahrainis want to remain independent.1971 - Bahrain declares independence and signs a new treaty of friendship with Britain.

She played the lead role of an astronomer looking for evidence of aliens in the 1997 film Contact.In a statement on the fund-raising website she explained her support: \"The Allen Telescope Array could turn science fiction into science fact but only if it is actively searching the skies.\"Another donor was the Apollo 8 astronaut, Bill Anders.The SETI Institute says the fund should be enough to keep the telescopes operating until the end of the year, though the plan is still dependent on the institute receiving money from the US Air Force to track space debris that could damage satellites.SETI Institute Astronomer Seth Shostak told BBC News, the deal with the Air Force is not yet done but he said he is fairly confident it will go through. Even then the money will need to be ratified by Congress and so there may be a delay.  He hopes the array will re-open in September or October.Thomas Pierson, SETI chief executive, agreed that a deal with the Air Force, combined with the donations, should allow the array to start listening for space chatter once again.He said: \"For those who are interested in understanding whether intelligent life might be out there elsewhere in our galaxy, the Allen Telescope Array and our SETI team doing the research are the best bet.\"The array began operating in 2007 and is named after its major benefactor, Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft. It consists of 42 dish-shaped antennas which work as a single radio telescope.It is part of the Hat Creek Radio Observatory, run by the University of California, Berkeley. Originally the array was a joint project between SETI Institute and the UC Berkeley Astronomy Laboratory but Berkeley had to pull out because of the loss of National Science Foundation grants and state budget cuts.SETI is hoping to raise more money to contribute to the $2.5m (£1.5m) annual operating and staffing costs of the telescopes and keep them going beyond the end of this year. Ultimately the plan is to use the array to observe planets outside our own Solar System.Dr Shostak said: \"People still think this very fundamental question - is there somebody out there as intelligent or more so than us - is important and worth doing.\"The array also contributes to research into black holes, pulsars and magnetic fields in the Milky Way.\n"," Telescopes looking for extra terrestrial intelligence should re-open within weeks after donors replaced income lost in public funding cuts.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 177 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 56.22115587393443  min ---  3373.2693543434143  sec ---\n","Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions responded in spectacular fashion to Manchester City's outstanding 5-1 win at Spurs by returning to the top of the table with a result that represented Arsenal's worst defeat since 1896.Wenger sent out a makeshift side depleted by injuries and suspensions - but even this cannot excuse the manner in which they were outclassed in all parts of the pitch and swept aside with such ease by United.Wayne Rooney was United's inspiration with the sixth hat-trick of his Old Trafford career, but Ashley Young also made his mark with two stunning goals. Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung were the other scorers.Media playback is not supported on this deviceTheo Walcott reduced United's three-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time but Robin van Persie's strike late in the second half-represented no measure of consolation for a dispirited, broken Arsenal.United keeper David de Gea distinguished himself with a fine penalty save from Van Persie moments after Welbeck had opened the scoring - and in a game of almost unrelenting misery for Arsenal, teenager Carl Jenkinson ensured they have failed to end a game with 11 players in any of their league games this season when he was sent off.Old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday.For Wenger it was a performance, or lack of one, that proved the folly of his summer of transfer inactionRead more of the blogThis result underscores the gulf that has opened up between United and Arsenal and Wenger will now seek to address the weaknesses in his squad and replace the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri.Ferguson's faith in the team that won so convincingly against Tottenham was rewarded with another thrilling attack-minded performance.Arsenal's uncertainty was partly explained by the unfamiliar make-up of their team, but the flaws were swiftly exposed by the manner in which United took the lead. Anderson's lofted pass was inventive but Arsenal's failure to react was ominous for what lay ahead, allowing Welbeck to head past Wojciech Szczesny.Van Persie then squandered an instant opportunity to equalise after referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty when Walcott tangled with Jonny Evans in the area. De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to make a fine save.And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as Young added the second after 28 minutes. Young found space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny's grasp at the Stretford End.Welbeck's game was cut short by a hamstring injury - but there was no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached.Walcott halted some of United's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time.It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal were torn apart amid a torrent of goals, near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny.Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece, again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper.It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a constant state of siege. Rooney was the creator for Nani with the pass that gave the Portuguese the opportunity to send a flamboyant chipped finish over Szczesny for United's fifth.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWith the Gunners in disarray, Park marked his arrival as substitute by lashing home an unstoppable finish before Van Persie briefly interrupted the one-way flow towards Arsenal's goal by beating De Gea.It barely seemed possible for matters to get worse for Arsenal, but the agony increased when Jenkinson was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for fouling Javier Hernandez as he raced clear.Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight minutes from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra.And United completed the scoring with their eighth in injury time, Young once again showing his eye for the spectacular with another curling shot.Wenger cut a despairing figure as he walked back to the dressing room at the final whistle after one of the darkest days of his career.Full Time   The referee blows for the end of the match.Chris Smalling gives away a free kick for an unfair challenge on Marouane Chamakh.

Somewhere in the dark, dense forests a grey wolf is on the prowl.The wolf was hunted almost to extinction in France in the 1930s but, protected as an endangered species, it is making a surprising comeback.Some 200 wolves have colonised the southern regions of France, divided into about 20 packs. They are believed to have crossed from Italy in the mid-1990s and they are moving ever further north.Lionel Serres has 250 sheep on the mountainside this summer. Each night he pens them in behind electric fences. But the wolf is a cunning predator and so far it has killed 17 of his ewes, while 10 more are missing.Sheep spookedOn the day we met, he was busy trying to recover an ewe that had been grabbed by a wolf around the neck. Its fleece was matted, thick with blood.\"We have had lots of dead and injured sheep,\" said Lionel. \"The flock is in a pretty sorry state. Some are lame, they are stressed, and some are so frightened they have miscarried lambs.\"At night the wolf will circle the pens until the sheep are spooked into jumping the electric fences.And so costly are these losses that in recent weeks Mr Serres has been forced to hire another shepherd, who will sleep alongside the sheep at night.He is not the only one with concerns. So angry are the farmers in this region, that on the road to Hautes Alpes, in south-eastern France, on the border with Italy, there are huge signs painted on the road - \"NO to the wolf.\"Two hundred wolves might not sound like a huge problem. But this year there have been almost 600 attacks in which more than 2,000 sheep have been killed. That constitutes a rise of 20% on the same period last year.So, under pressure from farmers and faced with an increasing number of attacks, the local prefect has finally ordered a hunt for one individual wolf thought to be doing much of the damage.Since an anti-hunting code was agreed in 2004, only four wolves have been killed in France. Under the present rules, the wolf can only be shot legally by government marksmen or by shepherds trained and licensed to defend their flocks.Remy Saunier, the chief wolf catcher for the area, is now sending small, nightly patrols into the mountains.'Mystical animal'\"The wolf will always take the easiest prey,\" he said. \"If it's easy he comes back, and that's what he's done here, every other night. We have tried to scare it with lights and noise but it returns. It is only our presence in these mountains that are limiting the wolf attacks.\"Most people in France have welcomed the return of the wolf. It is a beautiful, mystical animal. But if these people woke in the morning to find their flock decimated, they might change their opinion.\"Critics say there is no evidence wolf attacks are out of control and they blame some of these sheep deaths on wild dogs. Moreover, as farmers receive 130 euros (Â£115; $190) in compensation for every sheep killed by a wolf, critics claim there is an incentive to exaggerate the problem.Jean-Francois Darmstaedter, the secretary general of Ferus, a French wolf protection agency, says the shepherds need to work harder to protect their sheep - though some shepherds, he points out, are wolf supporters.\"Remember there are eight million dogs in France and 200 wolves,\" he said.\"And I would bet there are more dog attacks in these mountains than wolf attacks. In this small region here we have a pack of 15 wolves, and something like 8,000 wild dogs. They aren't always in the mountains, but when they are, they cause a real mess.\"'Heading for Paris'Mr Darmstaedter questions why the wolf has inspired such opposition in France. In neighbouring Italy, he says, pack numbers are three or four times as big.But then, the wolf has always provoked fear. In the 17th Century, so afraid were they of wolves, mostly rabid wolves, they were cursed in Gallic folklore by the story of Little Red Riding Hood.At a fair in Marvejols, further to the west, wolf expert Jean-Marc Moriceau is plugging his latest book, titled Man Against the Wolf.\"The wolf is a successful predator,\" he said. \"It can move huge distances in search of food. And we can safely assume that in 15 or 20 years' time, if no measures are put in place, then it's possible we will see one or two wolves hunting in the forests 80km to 100km [50-60 miles] south of Paris.\"Some say the expanding nature of the wolf's habitat will require that more controls are implemented - in France they are calling for a \"wolf parliament\", in which farmers, supporters, and politicians can all have their say.But the forests south of Paris are probably the grey wolf's limit. Western and northern France are no longer wooded or wild enough to sustain them - which means those who live in Paris, at least, can sleep easily in their beds.\n"," In the summer months high on the

Hispana, its cohorts and Roman cavalry defeat 30,000 Caledonians.Locations suggested in the past include Dunning in Perthshire, Carpow in Fife, Bennachie in Aberdeenshire and Culloden in the Highlands.Historic Scotland said an accurate site was needed for inclusion on its list.The body has commissioned research on Mons Graupius along with a number of other battle sites.It has already placed several battlefields including Bannockburn in 1314 and Culloden in 1746 on Scotland's Inventory of Historic Battlefields and earlier this month put out 11 other sites for public consultation.The list, which includes details on the boundaries and armies involved, will act as a guide to planning authorities.Historic Scotland's Dr Lesley MacInnes, said a decision had still to be made on whether Mons Graupius should be put forward for consideration as an entry on the inventory.The head of battlefields said: \"We have recently commissioned the research for a number of battlefields including Mons Graupius.\"The research will review all available evidence for these sites to establish if they meet the published criteria for inclusion in the inventory.\"Early sites such as Mons Graupius present particular challenges for accurate location which is one of the required criteria for inclusion.\"Dr MacInnes added: \"Any sites which are considered to be of national importance but cannot be accurately located cannot be included at this stage but will be kept under review should further information emerge to allow their inclusion.\"The research outcome for Mons Graupius will be clarified by the end of the financial year.\"Mons Graupius is believed to be wrapped up in the mysterious disappearance of the 9th Hispana in AD 120.The legion, cohorts of auxiliary light infantrymen from Gaul and Batavia along with cavalry were heavily outnumbered by Caledonians at the battlefield.However, the tactics of Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola left 10,000 tribesmen dead but relatively light casualties among the auxiliaries.There has been a long running debate on where the battle was fought.In his book Legions of Rome, historian Stephen Dando-Collins said no location has been \"reliably fixed\".Potential sites have been weighed up on the website Roman Scotland.It rates Dunning the most likely and Culloden among the least.Sites close to the Grampian mountains have also been suggested in the past.In his book, Dando-Collins connects Mons Graupius with the disappearance of the 9th after it was later posted to Carlisle.He said Caledonians had sought revenge for the defeat and ambushed and slaughtered the legion along with its affiliated units.Mystery surrounding the fate of the 9th inspired Rosemary Sutcliff's children's book Eagle of the Ninth and two recent films - The Eagle and Centurion.Scenes for The Eagle starring Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell were shot around Achiltibuie and Old Dornie, near Ullapool, and in the Cairngorms for Centurion.\n"," The most northerly battle fought by imperial Rome could be left out of an inventory of Scottish battlefields due to uncertainty over the site.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 183 /

He said further discussion was needed.It is widely thought that the deal fell through because of last-minute objections to it from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was reported to believe that India was in danger of supplying too much water to Bangladesh.Bangladesh expressed its \"frustration and dissatisfaction\" over Ms Banerjee's \"sudden u-turn\", which it said had kept the two countries from signing two very crucial deals.Correspondents say that the failure to implement the water-sharing deal probably led to them also not agreeing on an Indian overland transit route through Bangladesh because Dhaka has long argued that the one is dependent on the other.They say it will come as a big disappointment to Delhi which is eager to have better transport links with its north-eastern states.The two sides did, however, agree to extend trading ties, with Delhi granting Dhaka tax concessions on textile imports it receives from Bangladesh.Ties between the two countries have been strained in recent years following a series of border clashes and Indian concerns that Islamist militants have been using Bangladesh as a base.On Tuesday the leaders agreedCorrespondents say Mr Singh's two-day visit was partly aimed at countering growing Chinese influence in the region.The prime minister was returning a visit to Delhi by his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina in January last year.On Sunday, Bangladesh's Foreign Minister Dipu Moni described the visit as historic, saying it would \"pave the way for a prosperous future for the whole region\".\n"," Indian PM Manmohan Singh has concluded a historic visit to Bangladesh by signing a series of protocols but without agreement on two major issues.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 192 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 61.30592697064082  min ---  3678.3556201457977  sec ---\n","Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation.From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.This deferral period has been left in place because there is a \"window period\" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable.This window period is far less than 12 months.The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days.In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\"But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\"A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.If you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) can be read here.\n"," When I reported last year about the urgent need for blood donors I received many comments from gay men that they would like to donate but were unable to.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 193 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 61.60160967906316  min ---  3696.096583366394  sec ---\n","They want President Dmitry Medvedev to be confronted over a perceived failure to protect business against corruption.In a Sunday Times letter, they also call for the PM to raise the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006.The call is from Labour's Margaret Beckett, David Miliband, Jack Straw and Conservative Sir Malcolm Rifkind.The letter says hundreds of thousands of Russian businessmen are detained in jails after falling victim to corruption sanctioned by the authorities.They refer to these people as \"victims of an increasingly potent mix of corruption and lawlessness\".In their letter, the former foreign secretaries state: \"The dangers of this corruption do not stop at Russia's borders and Alexander Litvinenko's murder shows the consequences of such lawlessness hitting British shores.\"In this regard the prime minister has both a domestic and international duty to tackle this issue head on during his visit.\"Mr Cameron is flying to Moscow on Sunday in an attempt to improve relations with Mr Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.Strained relationsHe will be the first UK prime minister to visit the Russian capital since Tony Blair six years ago.Whitehall officials recently revealed that no UK minister or diplomat has spoken directly with Mr Putin for four years.The BBC's James Landale said the prime minister was expected to see Mr Putin but a formal meeting had not been confirmed.Relations between the UK and Russia have been strained since the murder of Mr Litvinenko, an ex-Russian security official who had been living in the UK.Litvinenko killing suspect speaks outMr Litvinenko - an outspoken Kremlin critic - was fatally poisoned.

This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse.

Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish.Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag.Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot.England's players had talked of \"blitzing\" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger.Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0.England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street.Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try.England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right.England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball.They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7.Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work.Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on.France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7.Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time -

everything an ancient artist might need in their workshop.This extraordinary discovery is reported in the journal Science.It is proof, say researchers, of our early ancestors' complexity of thought.\"This is significant because it is pushing back the boundaries of our understanding of when Homo sapiens - people like us - first became modern,\" said Prof Christopher Henshilwood from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.\"These finds indicate that humans were certainly thinking in a modern way, in a way that is cognitively advanced, at least 100,000 years ago,\" he told BBC News.Blombos Cave on the southern Cape Coast, 300km east of Cape Town, has been giving up remarkable archaeological treasures for more than 20 years.Scientists have been scraping down through its sandy sediments to find all manner of artefacts left by the Middle Stone Age people who occupied the limestone cavity.In 2002, researchers described 70,000-year-old blocks of ochre.  This soft stone contains iron oxides that can be used as a pigment, or colouring agent.But apart from some engravings on the blocks, there was little hard evidence to determine the precise purpose of the Blombos ochre. The new items seem to have had a much more obvious use - as the equipment to process paints.The finds include abalone shells with ochre residues inside. There are tools made of quartzite that were presumably employed to hammer and grind ochre into a powder in the shells. And there is evidence that charcoal and oil from seal bones were being added to the mix. It seems bone implements were also being used to turn and lift the paint pastes.All these artefacts were found together, almost as if someone had put them down intending to retrieve them at a later time, but then never coming back.  Sands blown in through the cave entrance subsequently buried the kits and locked them away until they were excavated in 2008.In the intervening three years, the finds have been subjected to a series of tests and assessments.Ochre can have non-artistic applications such as an additive in glues, but co-researcher Francesco d'Errico from the University of Bordeaux says the analysis of the residues in the shells points strongly to the production of paints.\"The absence of a resin or a wax suggests the ochre was not used to make a glue or a mastic. We think it may have been used to make a paint or a design,\" he explained.Prof Henshilwood added: \"It's possible the paint was used to paint bodies, human skin.  It could have been used to paint designs on leather or other objects. It could have been used for paintings on walls, although the surfaces of southern African caves are not ideal for the long-term preservation of rock art.\"The mere fact though that paints are being manufactured in a systematic way is indicative of a level of advanced thinking.It would have required a high degree of planning to bring together all of the elements of the kits; and if art really was the purpose, it suggests the cave dwellers of Blombos were capable of symbolic thought - the ability to let one thing represent another in the mind.This ability has been posited as the giant leap in human evolution that set our species apart from the rest of the animal world.Understanding when and where this behaviour first emerged is a key quest for scientists studying human origins.Until now, arguably the earliest examples of conceptual thinking were the pieces of shell jewellery discovered at Skhul Cave in Israel and from Oued Djebbana in Algeria.These artefacts have been dated to 90,000-100,000 years ago. The Blombos paint kits now sit alongside these other finds.Prof Chris Stringer from London's Natural History Museum commented: \"Twenty or 30 years ago, there was a view that Europe was really the place where all the big action was taking place - wonderful painted caves 30,000-35,000 years ago, and people decorating their bodies.\"We now know that this behaviour goes back far further in Africa; it goes back to 100,000 years, perhaps even more than 100,000 years.\"People were starting to express social identity in completely new ways.  And there is a view that this behaviour is linked with complex language. So, it may indicate these people were communicating in a fully modern way,\" he told BBC News.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n"," The kits used by humans 100,000 years ago to make paint have been found at the famous archaeological site of Blombos Cave in South Africa.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 204 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 64.63694581588109  min ---  3878.21675157547  sec ---\n","Most of the injuries were minor, but several people had been taken to hospital, one official said.The trains had come from Bakersfield and Los Angeles.

We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.\"But Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.Tory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.There is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.\"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis\", says Tim Montgomerie, \"every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.\"Analysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BSTDownload the Analysis podcastListen via the Radio 4 websiteFollow Analysis on FacebookLast month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.The meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for \"new thinking\" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.One of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described \"this in-or-out discussion\" as \"a bit crude\", and said she thinks the choice is between \"the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship\".The wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.Almost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.That in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply \"wave goodbye\" altogether.And Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.It is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.Those MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.Analysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October at 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST.

Direct aid was set to wind up in 2009, but the US agreed to an additional package of $250 million in January 2010.Tourism is low key, although growing in economic importance. Many visitors come from Taiwan, with which Palau has diplomatic ties. Taiwanese aid boosts the economy. The government is Palau's largest employer.Monoliths and other relics are reminders of an ancient culture that thrived on the islands, and despite Western trappings many Palauans identify strongly with their traditions and rites.Palau's recent history has been dominated by outside influences from Spain, Britain, Germany, Japan and the US.

European Economic Area and man so-called \"e-gates\" where passengers use their biometric passports.A UKBA spokesman said: \"The security of the UK border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action.\"However, union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk.Mr Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of \"blind panic\" at the 11th hour, he said, and accused the government of engaging in a misleading \"PR exercise\" about public sector pensions to try to force through \"damaging\" changes.\"Instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line, they should say today they want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute,\" he said.The government has confirmed earlier reports that UKBA is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike.In the wake of the recent row between Home Secretary Theresa May and former UK border force chief Brodie Clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer, it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues.The BBC has also learned that the government has told union bosses that they are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes.The government recently made what it describes as an improved offer to the unions, promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to their pensions. It also promised improved accrual rates.Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill.Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but they insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector.Unions say their members are being asked to work longer, contribute more and receive less.\n"," Civil servants from across Whitehall are being lined up to act as border staff at UK ports and airports during next week's public sector strikes.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 220 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 69.11014307737351  min ---  4146.608586549759  sec ---\n","The health board said the man did not access to the woman's medical records.It said the cleaner had got the patient's name from an electronic floor plan at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.The woman visited the accident and emergency department last week for treatment to a hand injury.The next day she was contacted on the social networking site by the man, who said he had been \"checking her out\" while she was being treated in hospital and that he had got her name from the computer.He is also believed to have asked the woman \"how's the hand?\".The cleaner has been suspended and police are investigating.NHS Lothian conducted its own inquiry and found the cleaner did not manage to access any of the woman's confidential records.The health board's chief operating officer Jackie Sansbury said: \"He had no access to private medical records and information which is protected by a range of complex security systems.\"We understand that this member of contracted staff only gained the patient's name from an electronic screen for staff showing a floor plan in the treatment area of Accident and Emergency Department, in much the same way as a patient's name would be displayed above their bed in a ward area.\"This in no way excuses behaviour of this kind, however, and security messages have been reinforced to our staff and sub-contracted employees to ensure they comply with our data security guidelines.\"Any member of staff who breaks our rules will face investigation under our disciplinary procedures.\"Earlier, Consort, the private company which employs the man, said they were treating the matter very seriously.Lothian and Borders Police said they had received a complaint and were looking into the matter.The woman told The Scotsman newspaper: \"I didn't know who he was, what he was capable of, or whether he also knew my address and telephone number.\"I didn't know if he was just going to turn up at the house.

Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.\"We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,\" explained Ms Gardent.\"Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.\"The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.\"The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,\" Ms Gardent emphasised.\"We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.\"The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.

More than 50,000 hip and 70,000 knee, replacements take place in the UK each year.While they can last for decades, some fail within years. This can happen when the bone around the implant is dissolved by the body meaning the replacement joint becomes loose.The theory was that bisphosphonates, which are used by patients with osteoporosis to prevent bone being broken down, would prevent the loosening.The researchers looked at data from General Practice Research Database for joint replacements and compared what happened to 1,912 patients taking bisphosphonates with 41,995 patients who did not.After five years, 1.96% of implants failed without the drug, compared with 0.93% in those taking medication.Prof Nigel Arden, a specialist in rheumatic diseases at the Universities of Oxford and Southampton, said the first implant would cost the NHS about Â£7,000, but replacements would cost Â£34,000.He told the BBC: \"It has the potential to have a huge impact.\"He said two of the risk factors, age and obesity, meant the number of cases was \"increasing dramatically\".Prof Arden is not arguing that people should be given the drug yet. He has applied for funding for a further trial to test the effectiveness of bisphosphonates and which patients would benefit most.The chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies welcomed the findings.\"With such a high incidence of knee and hip replacement surgery, the possibility that the life of joint implants could be lengthened and reduce the number of complex revision surgeries means that these results have the potential to make significant improvements to the lives of many NHS patients,\" she said.\n"," Using a bone-strengthening drug could make joint replacements last longer, according to an analysis of GPs' records.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 227 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 71.94830310344696  min ---  4316.898187637329  sec ---\n","The UK government gave Northern Ireland the power to reduce the level of the tax because it said it had a special economic case.That prompted calls from Scottish and Welsh airports for similar treatment.The UK Treasury said it had not ruled out devolving APD to Scotland and Wales in the future.A report published following a consultation on reform of APD said the government at Westminster would \"continue to explore the feasibility and likely effects of devolution to Scotland and Wales\".Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne announced the duty would be cut for direct long-haul routes from Northern Ireland airports, and he would devolve control over the tax to the Northern Irish Assembly.The move came in response to fears that some routes could be scrapped due to competition from Irish airports where APD is much lower.Commenting on the UK Government's decision not to grant the Scottish government similar powers for now, Jim O'Sullivan, managing director of Edinburgh Airport, said: \"APD is already costing Scotland passengers and having an impact on tourism revenues.\"We know from discussions with our airline partners that it is a major factor in their decision to connect further routes to Scotland.\"We would urge the Westminster Government to see Scotland as it does Northern Ireland and understand the need to both reduce and devolve this unfair and damaging tax.\"Amanda McMillan, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said: \"On the question of devolution of APD, Glasgow Airport has always been supportive of this proposal given the Scottish government's more progressive approach to aviation and its greater appreciation of the role the industry plays in supporting the growth of the Scottish economy.\"Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown said the case for devolving APD was \"compelling\" and had been backed by all four of Scotland's biggest airports, and recommended by the Calman Commission.He added: \"We need to be able to deal with the competitive and connectivity disadvantages that Scotland faces and if APD were devolved now we could provide the means to incentivise airlines to provide new direct international connections to Scotland, benefiting our aviation industry and our passengers and supporting the growth of the Scottish economy.\"The UK government needs to listen to the many voices in Scotland who clearly want to see full devolution of the policy on APD.\"\n"," Scottish airport operators have said they are dismayed and disappointed that the control of air passenger duty (APD) will not be devolved to Scotland.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 228 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 72.20374451478322  min ---  4332.224672794342  sec ---\n","This year's award was won jointly by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia, Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian peace activist, and Yemeni pro-democracy campaigner Tawakkol Karman.They were recognised for their \"non-violent struggle\" for women's safety and for women's rights to participate in peace-building work.Chinese lawyer Liu Xiaobo won in 2010.Each of this year's winners was presented with a gold medal and a diploma.The prize money of $1.5 million (Â£958,000) will be shared between them.Mrs Sirleaf, 72, is Africa's first elected female head of state and is credited with helping to end Liberia's 14 year civil war.

This echoes the findings of the independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel.\"Clearly a feeling existed that desirable consumer goods could be made available by looting. There was a substantial element of opportunistic criminality and copycat behaviour,\" the report said.\"The absence of a police presence or sight of police officers apparently standing by and allowing criminal behaviour to take place was distressing for those whose homes and businesses were being attacked,\" it added.Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: \"Individual police officers acted with great bravery, and we commend them for their actions. However, in London and other areas, in contrast with the effectiveness of police responses in some towns and cities, there was a failure of police tactics.\"This situation might have been avoided had police appreciated the magnitude of the task.\"We urgently require a rapid improvement in police training to deal with public disorder. We urge the police to act more quickly in future and to review the arrangements for loaning officers from one force to another in this type of scenario.\"He said that, for those who lost their homes and businesses, \"the state effectively ceased to exist - sometimes for hours at a time\".Mr Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the committee felt that there should have been better communication between the police and the local business community to ensure that people knew what was happening and how best to protect their livelihoods.\"Those areas where the chief constables had decided to take pre-emptive action and get police officers on the streets quickly were able to contain this violence much more effectively,\" he added.The MPs say had more officers been deployed different tactics could have been used. The Met Police is training more police to use baton rounds and is considering buying three water cannon.Mr Vaz said the committee did not feel water cannon would have helped police in the riots and may have caused \"even greater disorders\".Riots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest spread across London and to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol over the following days.But the committee's report said the specific causes behind the riots were still unknown.The report criticised the Met Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission over failures in communication with Mr Duggan's family, which it said made a potentially tense situation worse.The committee also concluded it would be unhelpful to switch off social media during times of disorder, following claims rioters used it to organise themselves.\"People who made an active decision to join in the disorder could equally well have heard about it on the television as on social media,\" the report said.The MPs say the government needs to urgently clarify whether the police authorities will be able to recover the Â£89.827m it cost to police the riots. It says the riots were an exceptional series of events at a time the authorities were being asked to make savings.They also call on the government to speed up the process of reimbursing people under the Riot Damages Act.The Met Police said it had already recognised and publicised some of its findings on the issues identified and what it was doing to improve.A spokesman said: \"This includes acknowledging that we didn't have enough officers available quickly enough to respond to the initial disorder or its subsequent unprecedented escalation. As a result we have changed our mobilisation plans.\"He added that the force was reviewing how it engaged with local communities and was working with Acpo and the IPCC to ensure communication was more effective in future investigations.The Association of Chief Police Officers said the report had identified issues it believed was critical to get right within current policing reforms.\"This includes the capacity and ability to move sufficient numbers of police officers around the country when required to protect the public from national threats,\" a spokesman said.\"We will continue to look at all the various reports into the disorder to examine how the police service can best respond in future to the kind of exceptional criminality seen in August.\"\n"," The policing operation to tackle the summer riots across England was flawed, a report from MPs has concluded.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 237 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 75.0754932999611  min ---  4504.5295996665955  sec ---\n","The investment follows \"several months of negotiations\", a company statement to the Saudi stock exchange said.The prince, who is one of the world's richest men, owns stakes in many well-known companies, including News Corporation.He also has investments in a number of media groups in the Arab world.\"Our investment in Twitter reaffirms our ability in identifying suitable opportunities to invest in promising, high-growth businesses with a global impact,\" Prince Alwaleed said.\n"," Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Company has announced a $300m (Â£194m) investment in social media site Twitter.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 238 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 75.24859547217687  min ---  4514.915729999542  sec ---\n","Microsoft has revealed details of a login system for the next version of Windows based around pictures a user stores on a touchscreen device.Only when parts of an image are tapped or touched in the right order will a user be able to access a device.Experts said it might stop people using weak passwords but could lead to other loopholes that are harder to solve.Microsoft aired the idea of using images to sign on to a device via a blog written by engineers working on Windows 8 - the next version of the Windows operating system expected to be released in late 2012.Windows 8 is designed for touchscreen devices such as tablets and the novel sign-on systems makes use of the sensitive displays they are likely to sport.The familiar process of getting to use a desktop PC or laptop by typing in a password made of up lower and upper case letters as well as numbers was felt to be too \"cumbersome\" for tablets,wrote Microsoft engineer Zach Pace on the blog.The replacement system proposed by Microsoft employs a picture chosen by a user from their collection of images on a device.On this image, users are encouraged to tap on, underline or circle the parts that are important to them. The sequence of gestures, including start and end positions and orientation act as a key to unlock the device.User-testing suggests that the image-based system can grant access to a portable gadget far faster than was possible through text-based passwords, wrote Mr Pace.He stressed that the system would work alongside text-based passwords rather than replace them. If a user failed to properly reproduce the correct gestures fives times in a row they would be prompted for the password they set up when they first used the device.The permutations of taps, touches and circles that could be drawn on a picture was likely to be far higher than those available from text-based passwords, said Prof Alan Woodward from the department of computing at the University of Surrey.That was especially true, he said, when one considered the limited number of words from which most people picked their passwords.\"The initial calculations show that it is likely to provide a level of security that is at least as strong as a password, and frankly, stronger than most passwords chosen by users,\" he added.Graham Cluley, senior security researcher at Sophos, said the research was \"interesting and cute\" but may introduce other security problems.It could, he said, make people vulnerable to \"shoulder surfing\" - a practice better known from cash machines where crooks try to spot a victim's Pin as they tap it into a number pad.\"With normal password entry, what you're doing is asterisked on the screen,\" said Mr Cluley. \"With this gesture input, folks may find it easier to see the movements you are making.\"There might be more value in operating systems encouraging people to use stronger passwords by refusing to let them use dictionary words or ones that are easy to crack, he added.\n"," Using Windows 8 devices could involve signing on by tapping, circling or touching images.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 239 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 75.65870756705603  min ---  4539.522455453873  sec ---\n","Thames Water said it was called out 101 times on Christmas Day 2010 to deal with blockages.It said fat should be put in a container and, once it has cooled down, disposed of in a bin.To highlight the problem a group of sewer men and women have posted on YouTube a rewritten version of the carol Deck the HallsThames Water said 25% more fat -

They then monitored the change in the height of the overlying water during the course of 201 days.What the scientists saw was a clear spike in the data twice a day - the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun.

They have been likened to the caps on the ends of shoelaces - they stop things from unravelling.Over time they wear down - and when they do, the DNA they protect is compromised and the cell can malfunction or die.This is where the zebra finches came in: how early and accurately could longer telomeres predict a longer life?To find out, the Glasgow researchers collaborated with colleagues at Exeter University, with Glasgow's Prof Pat Monaghan leading the team.Tiny blood samples were taken from a group of 99 zebra finches and the lengths of their telomeres measured. They were tested again throughout their lifetimes.To find out how long the birds lived, the researchers had to wait until they died.  The first turned up its claws in just over six months.  But the last hardy specimen kept them waiting almost nine years.In every case the longest lived birds had the longest telomeres, but the best predictor of lifespan was the length of the telomeres at just 25 days old.Prof Monaghan says the study shows the importance of processes acting early in life.The next step will be to find out why the length of telomeres can vary so much from individual to individual.\"We now need to know more about how early life conditions can influence the pattern of telomere loss and the relative importance of inherited and environmental factors,\" she said.The results of the research have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA.They are certain to raise the question of whether our telomeres are similar predictors of how long we will live.But it is a big leap from the laboratory to the real world - whatever our telomeres may say, human lifespans also have to contend with additional factors like diet, drink and stress.Wild finches, meanwhile, have snakes and birds of prey to worry about.The bottom line for now?

It alleged he deliberately changed course to perform a risky night-time sail-past salute to people on the tiny island of Giglio.He told his trial he \"wanted to kill three birds with one stone\": to please the passengers, salute a retired captain on Giglio and do a favour to the vessel's head waiter, who was from the island. He has rejected rumours that he had wanted to impress his lover, Domnica Cemortan, with him at the helm.As details of the unplanned change of course emerged, ship owner Costa Cruises distanced itself from the captain who, it said, had made \"serious errors of judgement\" and carried out a manoeuvre \"unauthorised, unapproved and unknown to Costa\".The captain told the court that he had been been sacrificed to safeguard \"economic interests\", arguing that the court should be considering an entire organisation rather than one man.In a TV interview given hours after the ship ran aground, Mr Schettino's shock and disbelief was clear as he told reporters the rocks had not been shown on his charts.\"We were about 300 metres from the rocks, more or less, we shouldn't have hit anything.\"Widely vilified in Italy for leaving his ship while passengers were still on board, Capt Schettino's reputation was further damaged when transcripts suggested he had not told the coastguard initially of the gravity of the damage to the ship.\"Listen Schettino, perhaps you have saved yourself from the sea, but I will make you look very bad. I will make you pay for this. Dammit, go back on board!\" says Coastguard Capt Gregorio De Falco, repeatedly ordering him to return to the ship.Speaking by radio from a lifeboat, Capt Schettino said he was co-ordinating the rescue from there, pleading at one point: \"Do you realise that it is dark and we can't see anything?\"The coastguard shouts back: \"So, what do you want to do, to go home, Schettino?! It's dark and you want to go home? Go to the bow of the ship where the ladder is and tell me what needs to be done, how many people there are, and what they need! Now!\"A taxi driver who says he took the captain to a hotel the morning after the sinking said the captain had asked only where he could buy some socks.\"He looked like a beaten dog, cold and scared,\" the taxi driver said.Capt Schettino has accepted some degree of responsibility, asking for forgiveness in a television interview in 2012 as he talked of those who died.He said he blamed himself for being \"distracted\" but said that he had not been on the bridge when the ship ran aground.In the interview, he broke down when asked about the youngest of the 32 victims, a five-year-old girl.As the accusations against Capt Schettino grew, there were those who came to his defence, including sailors, who agreed with his assertion that his decision to steer the ship towards shallower waters had probably saved dozens of lives.His defence lawyers accused the prosecution of focusing on him while offering plea bargains to five co-defendants, jailed in July 2013 for up to two years and 10 months.According to an interview in Naples-based Il Mattino newspaper quoting his sister, the first person Capt Schettino called after the incident was his 80-year-old mother, Rosa.\"He called her at five in the morning on Saturday to tell her there had been a disaster, that he had tried to save as many passengers as possible and not to worry, because it was all over,\" she said.As he asked for a 26-year sentence, prosecutor Stefano Pizza listed all the mistakes Capt Schettino had made and said: \"May God have pity on Schettino, because we cannot.\"\n"," Capt Francesco Schettino has been found guilty of multiple manslaughter in Italy and sentenced to 16 years in jail for his role in one of the country's worst maritime disasters.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 256 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 80.13298749923706  min ---  4807.979251861572  sec ---\n","The former army officer promised to be \"even more dangerous than when I was in uniform\".He also vowed to turn his tiny West African nation into an \"economic superpower\" over the next five years.President Jammeh first seized power in 1994 but was re-elected in December in a widely criticised poll.\"You cannot be in your offices every day doing nothing... and at the end of the day you expect to be paid,\" he said on a televised address on Wednesday.\"This has to stop.

members of the Church's governing body, the General Synod, that the rises could have an impact on poorer couples.The Rev Canon Simon Killwick, a vicar in Moss Side, Manchester, said: \"Such a fee increase seems to me hard to justify in times of financial austerity and even harder to justify in poor inner-city parishes.\"The Church of England ought not to be seen to be making a big increase at

The case involving her and her parents is due to start at the end of the month.By Clive ColemanBBC News legal correspondentThis latest round of settlements represents a continued waving of the white flag by News International in the civil cases for breach of privacy arising out of the phone hacking at the former News of the World.The vast majority of the original 60-odd cases have now been settled. And the more they settle, the more difficult it becomes for News International to defend one.The case brought by the singer Charlotte Church and her family is due for trial, as are five other cases.  Whether any of them will actually get there seems doubtful.The settlement sums reflect the level of hacking, the period over which it took place and the number of articles that were written based upon the information hacked.But this is not even the beginning of the end.

It wants Nigeria ruled by strict Islamic law and its recruits take quite different journeys from that of the man in his twenties from a very wealthy northern Nigerian family, now in the hands of the US penal system.A neighbour of the Abdulmutallab family in Kaduna, prominent rights activist Shehu Sani, told me a lighter sentence would give Umar Farouk a deserved chance to rehabilitate. The blame should lie with the terrorists who took advantage of the model student, as he was too young to know better, he said.Some in the Muslim north think the whole case is a US conspiracy. There is far less sympathy for him in the Christian south. Matthew, a banker, said that a death sentence would be justified. Having harmed Nigeria's image, as Boko Haram is doing now, Matthew said the 25-year-old does not deserve a second chance.Sentencing guidelines directed the judge to impose a mandatory life sentence, but Mr Chambers appealed for a lighter term.\"Not one passenger lost his or her life. Not one passenger suffered life-threatening injuries,\" he said.Prosecutors said a life sentence was warranted because an attempted terror attack heightens public fear and burdens airports with expensive and time-consuming security procedures.As part of the sentencing hearing, four passengers and a crew member aboard Flight 253 made statements, telling the judge the event had forever changed their lives.A video from the FBI showing the power of the explosive material found in Abdulmutallab's underwear was also shown at the hearing. As the video played Abdulmutallab twice said loudly \"Allahu akbar\" - Arabic for \"God is great\".Abdulmutallab himself made a brief statement. During the short trial, he had fired his lawyer and attempted to represent himself.\"Mujahideen are proud to kill in the name of God,\" he said in court. \"And that is exactly what God told us to do in the Koran... Today is a day of victory.\"\"In quick response to some of the things that have been said, I say my life and the lives of Muslims have also changed due to the attacks on innocent civilians,\" he added.On the second day of his trial, in October, Abdulmutallab unexpectedly declared that he would plead guilty to all charges.The bomb was a \"blessed weapon to save the lives of innocent Muslims\", he told the court.\"The US should be warned that if they continue to kill and support those who kill innocent Muslims, then the US should await a great calamity... or God will strike them directly,\" he added.Investigators said Abdulmutallab admitted he was working for AQAP, and had been inspired by and had met Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric who was killed in 2011 by a US drone strike in Yemen.Abdulmutallab received the bomb, as well as training, from AQAP before travelling from Nigeria to Amsterdam.There he boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew members.The bomb was not picked up in security checks at airports in Lagos and Amsterdam.On board, the bomb failed to detonate completely and passengers had to put out the fire.Abdulmutallab's father, Alhaji Umaru Mutallab, an influential banker who is well connected in Nigerian politics, said he had approached the US embassy officials and Nigerian authorities in 2009 to warn them about his son.Abdulmutallab was already on a US watch list, but not a no-fly list.\n"," A Nigerian man accused of trying to bomb a US-bound flight on Christmas Day 2009 has been sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 273 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 84.85074140230815  min ---  5091.044485807419  sec ---\n","Eric Bikubi, 28, and his partner Magalie Bamu, aged 29, have been convicted at the Old Bailey of killing Kristy Bamu after accusing him of being a sorcerer who practised witchcraft.The couple, who live in Newham, acted after accusing Kristy of controlling and adversely influencing a young boy, the jury was told.They originally came from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where witchcraft is called Kindoki, and exorcisms are carried out in some churches.In 2010, Unicef reported 20,000 children accused of witchcraft were living on the streets of DR Congo's capital Kinshasa.In the DR Congo, accusing a child of being possessed is a criminal offence, a law that has been in place for several years.But in 2008 I travelled to Kinshasa to see if it was making any difference and, at that time, the answer was not at all.Which is why I found myself in one of the city's slums late at night knocking on the door of tin-roofed shack that doubled as a church.Pastor Tsimba let me in and showed me three children who he had diagnosed as having Kindoki.The youngest was probably six, the oldest no more than 12. They had been in the church for days, deprived of food and forced to work. Their parents were paying for the privilege.The only light came from flickering candles and storm lamps. The pastor began to shout and pray.One by one he brought the children up to the front of the church. He ordered them to lie down and, still shouting and chanting, began slapping their stomachs, one, two, three times. Each harder than the last.Then he took a candle and poured burning hot wax on them, leaving them grimacing and squirming but making almost no sound. Their eyes were wide and staring.Finally, as a bizarre conclusion to the ritual, Pastor Tsimba produced a length of pipe and held it hard against their belly buttons.One after another, he made a play of sucking hard on the pipe and in triumph then spat a lump of meat he claimed to have sucked out of them into a bowl.The meat he claimed had been been fed to them by a witch, infecting them with Kindoki.

There was not enough room for them all in the public gallery.Prosecuting QC Sasha Wass said Mr Ibori, 53, had \"tricked\" his way into becoming Delta state governor, by giving a false date of birth and claiming he had no criminal record.\"He was never the legitimate governor and there was effectively a thief in government house. As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta state's wealth and hand out patronage.\"He is due to be sentenced on 16 April.Ibori's wife, Theresa, his sister, Christine, his mistress, Udoamaaka Okoronkwo, and his London solicitor, Bhadresh Gohil, have all been convicted of money-laundering.Their convictions could only be reported on Monday after reporting restrictions were lifted.Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had asked the UK's Metropolitan Police to look into the ex-governor's financial affairs.\"The vast sums of money involved were used to fund Mr Ibori's lavish lifestyle,\" Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, the officer in charge of the investigation, said.\"We will now be actively seeking the confiscation of all of his stolen assets so they can be repatriated for the benefit of the people of Delta State.\"He said that the money Ibori stole should have been used to pay for sanitation, power supplies and healthcare for some of the poorest people in the world.Ibori spent some of the stolen money buying six houses in London - he paid £2.2m in cash for one Hampstead mansion - and put his children in expensive British private schools, police say.Three of the money-laundering charges relate to the sale of Delta state's share in mobile phone company V-Mobile to neighbouring Akwa Ibom state.This raised $37m which Ibori stole and laundered through his solicitor Gohil, who has been jailed for 10 years.In 2007, a UK court froze assets allegedly belonging to him worth $35m.His annual salary as Delta state governor was less than $25,000.He had already left the UK when his assets were seized but he was arrested in Nigeria later that year.The charges were dismissed but he was then re-arrested in Dubai on a British warrant.Ibori has been convicted in the UK before - in 1991 for stealing, in cahoots with his wife who worked as a cashier, from the Neasden, London, branch of the DIY shop Wickes.He was also found guilty in 1992 for being in possession of a stolen credit card and having used it to fraudulently withdraw $1,590.Nigeria is one of the world's biggest oil producers.

The Badger Trust says the guidance given to Natural England is unlawful.Potentially the most important element of its case concerns the methods used to kill badgers.In the landmark UK study, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), badgers were trapped before being shot.However, the government plans to allow licensed contractors to shoot badgers as they roam - \"free shooting\" - which is likely to be less efficient and to increase disruption of badger families.The RBCT showed that when badger's social groups are disrupted, they roam further, carrying the TB bacterium to more farms.For this reason, the trust argues that after the pilots, farmers may be forced to resort to trap-and-shoot, because free shooting will either prove ineffective or a hazard to public safety.That would escalate the cost by anything up to a factor of 10 - and the Badger Trust says this possibility damages the government's economic case for a cull.As the majority of new cases arise through infection from other cattle rather than from badgers, the trust says the government should simply invest in stricter cattle control measures.Regulations on farmers were recently tightened and testing regimes intensified - but the National Farmers' Union, the government and other proponents believe culling is needed in badly affected areas in addition to existing measures.In 2010, 25,000 cattle were slaughtered as a result of TB infection, and the disease is costing the UK taxpayer in the region of Â£100m per year.They also argue that culling would in the end benefit badgers, as TB infection is seriously debilitating to them.\"Nobody wants to see badgers culled, but no country in the world where wildlife carries TB has successfully controlled the disease in cattle without tackling its presence in wildlife as well,\" said a Defra spokeswoman.\"Unless further action is taken now, it will continue to get worse.\"Badgers are protected under UK law, and also under the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.Campaigners are also considering using this as another weapon to use in the long-running battle over culling.Last year, wildlife groups began programmes of vaccination, and some animal groups believe this will in the end remove any need for culling.The Welsh Assembly Government is due to announce its decision on a proposed pilot cull in West Wales early this year.Follow Richardon Twitter\n"," The Badger Trust has launched a new legal challenge to the government's plans to cull badgers in England.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 281 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 87.41156524817148  min ---  5244.693916559219  sec ---\n","Officials say the photo of Ms Badu in The Star newspaper was \"an insult to Islam\".

For decades, settlement has been granted on the basis of length of time living in - and ties to - the UK, recognising that people who have been living in the country for five years have made it their permanent home.Prime Minister David Cameron says he wants to reduce annual net migration to \"tens of thousands\" from the current level of around 250,000.It is aiming to bring the figure, which includes students and the families of visa holders, to below 100,000 by 2015 - a year before the latest restriction is due to come into force.In a written statement to Parliament, Mrs May said: \"Until now, settlement has been a virtually automatic consequence of five years' residence in the UK as a skilled worker. Those who have settled have tended to be less well paid and lower-skilled than those who have not.\"And the volumes of migrant workers settling have reached record levels in recent years.\"According to official figures, in 1997 fewer than 10,000 migrant workers and their dependants were granted settlement, but by 2010 this had risen to 84,000.Mrs May said: \"So in future, we will exercise control to ensure that only the brightest and best remain permanently.\"The £35,000 earnings threshold will be waived for any \"shortage occupations\" if official advisers tell ministers that the UK needs more workers with skills or training.Scientists and researchers in PhD level jobs will also be exempt from the earnings test.Nicola Dandridge of Universities UK, said: \"The government has responded to the concerns... by exempting PhD-level jobs from the new pay threshold for settlement.\"We argued strongly that such international academics and researchers should be made exempt from any pay threshold on the basis that their salaries are not comparable to those of highly skilled migrants working in other sectors.\"If we are to continue to produce Nobel Prize-winning research and groundbreaking work, we must offer a welcoming environment to the best academics from around the world.\"The government says it will also restrict the arrival of foreign domestic workers to those who are travelling with their employers, such as diplomats or business people temporarily working in the UK.Mrs May said: \"We recognise that the ODW (overseas domestic worker) routes can at times result in the import of abusive employer/employee relationships to the UK.\"It is important that those who use these routes to bring their staff here understand what is and is not acceptable. So we will be strengthening pre-entry measures to ensure that domestic workers and their employers understand their respective rights and responsibilities.\"Under the new rules, overseas domestic workers who come to the UK with their employer must leave after six months. Those working in diplomats' households can stay for up to five years. The workers will not be able to extend their stay, switch employer, sponsor dependants or seek settlement.Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said of the new salary cap: \"People should only be allowed to settle in this country under these rules if they can pay their way, live by our rules and contribute value to our country. We need strict controls, properly enforced, and all of the mainstream parties should agree on that.\"However, there is still a massive gap between the Tory-led Government's rhetoric and reality.

We can only do that we leave the EU and repudiate the European Court of Justice.\"The government says it is making progress towards its plan to cut net migration to tens of thousands a year - the balance between those arriving and those leaving.But on WednesdayOxford University experts predictedthat even if ministers hit the target by the end of the Parliament, net migration could very quickly \"bounce\" up again.Researchers at the Migration Observatory said current cuts were affecting groups of migrants who were less likely to stay in the UK for the long-term, such as students.In turn, that meant that the UK would start receiving proportionally more migrants who would want to settle for the long-term than leave.

German troops occupied Estonia during World War II, before being driven out by the Soviet army.Few nations formally recognised the Soviet annexation, and Estonians consider it an illegal occupation.One of its legacies is a large Russian minority - about a quarter of the population, according to the 2011 census. In Soviet times, the influx of non-Estonians led some to fear for the survival of Estonian culture and language.The Russians' status has been a cause of controversy. Some, including the Russian government, criticise requirements needed to obtain Estonian citizenship - especially the need to show a proficiency in the Estonian language - that left most ethnic Russians stateless after independence.Estonia says the criteria for citizenship are similar to those of most nations around the world, and have been in any case gradually eased. It says the number of stateless persons has dropped by 80% between 1992 and 2013.Since independence, Estonia has politically and economically anchored itself firmly to the West, joining the EU and Nato in 2004. It sent a contingent of troops as part of Nato operations in Afghanistan.Russia's intervention in the Ukrainian crisis in 2014 has triggered some nervousness in Estonia over President Vladimir Putin's intentions towards other former Soviet states. The Estonian government has been fiercely critical of Russia's behaviour and has affirmed its pro-Nato stance in response to the events in Ukraine.Estonian governments have tended to pursue strongly free-market economic policies, privatising state enterprises, introducing a flat-rate income tax, liberalising regulation, encouraging free trade and keeping public debt low.There has also been a strong emphasis on making Estonia a world leader in technology, leading some to speak of an \"e-economy\".This has included creating one of the world's fastest broadband networks, offering widespread free wireless internet, encouraging technology start-ups and putting government services online. In 2007, Estonia was the first country to allow online voting in a general election.The country experienced an investment boom in the early 2000s, especially after EU membership, with high annual growth rates hovering between 7-10%.In 2008, Estonia's economy was hit by the global financial crisis. The government adopted tough austerity measures and won plaudits for getting the economy back into shape.The country joined the European single currency in January 2011.The Estonian language is closely related to Finnish and - more distantly - Hungarian, but not to the Indo-European languages of the two other Baltic states - Latvia and Lithuania - or Russian for that matter.The country has unique musical and dance traditions, including a long tradition of choral singing.\n"," Estonia is the most northerly of the three Baltic states, and has linguistic ties with Finland.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 287 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 89.8654619773229  min ---  5391.927720546722  sec ---\n","The money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.Once built, the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.The current hospital was built in 1813, but it has become cramped and outdated.The total cost of the project is £33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.Matron Sue Taylor said: \"It's very old and in the summer it's very, very hot.

With the right equipment, it is possible to see dark regions called sunspots. But up close, our Sun is a dynamic, violent beast.Bright loops of matter arch and twist like fiery fountains above the surface of this gigantic natural nuclear reactor. And every so often an intense burst of radiation called a solar flare appears when magnetic energy - stored in our star's atmosphere - is suddenly released.Solar flares are sometimes associated with the release of high energy particles into space - eruptions that are known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), though these can also occur on their own.A large CME can contain billions of tonnes of gas and other matter that pours into space at several million km per hour. The charged particles in this cloud stream towards any planet or spacecraft in its path.When these particles collide with the Earth, they can cause a geomagnetic storm - a disturbance in the magnetic sheath (or magnetosphere) that surrounds our planet, protecting its denizens from the worst effects of cosmic rays.Many of the effects of charged particles hitting the Earth's magnetosphere are benign, such as polar lights - the Aurora borealis and australis.Geomagnetic storms - often referred to as solar storms - cause these northern or southern lights to become visible at lower latitudes.However, they also disrupt technology on Earth, such as communications systems - including those used by aircraft, satellite navigation signals and electrical power grids.As such, they could wreak long-lasting havoc with communications and power infrastructure across the globe.A 2008 report by the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that an extreme storm could cause up to $2 trillion in initial damages by crippling communications on Earth and causing chaos around the world.As such, several agencies around the world are working to better understand the changing conditions near our planet - known collectively as space weather.Forecasters at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center monitor activity using data from a network of sensors, including those on satellites, and US Geological Survey instruments that detect magnetic fields (magnetometers).The Sun goes through cycles of high and low activity that repeat approximately every 11 years. It is currently gaining in activity and is expected to peak in 2013 or 2014, although nobody can be sure.This means we can expect more solar flares and more coronal mass ejections over the next few years. The solar cycle we're currently in has been a relatively quiet one in compared with previous ones.But that does not mean that there could not be a large event in the build up to the next \"solar maximum\".Yes. In 1994, a solar storm caused major malfunctions to two communications satellites, disrupting television and radio services throughout Canada.In March 1989, another event caused the Hydro-Quebec power grid in Canada to go down for over nine hours. The resulting damages and loss in revenue were estimated to be in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars.But the most significant historic event remains the great solar storm of 1-2 September 1859. This disturbance shorted telegraph wires, starting fires in North America and Europe, and caused bright aurorae to be seen in Cuba and Hawaii.In 1859, our technological infrastructure was in its infancy, but a storm with the magnitude of the so-called Carrington Event would be much more damaging today.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n"," Solar storms are a natural occurrence caused by high-energy particles hitting the Earth.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 289 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 90.59290293455123  min ---  5435.574177980423  sec ---\n","Its reach has also expanded across the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert, attracting members from Mauritania, Morocco, Niger and Senegal as well as from within Mali where, in alliance with other Islamists, it is fighting French troops on the ground.During the Mali crisis, its fighters have dramatically increased their profile, allowing them to further their aim of spreading Islamic law and jihad across West Africa.AQIM's influence over other nascent Islamist cells comes from its wealth: it is one of the region's best-armed groups thanks to the money it makes from kidnapping Westerners and drug and cigarette trafficking across the Sahara.It emerged in early 2007, after a feared militant group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), aligned itself with Osama Bin Laden's international network.Back in the 1990s, against a background of Islamist political groups testing their strength across North Africa, the military-backed authorities in Algeria at first permitted the Islamists to play a full part in the nation's political life.But then, when the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to sweep the board in a 1992 general election, they annulled the whole process and took power back.The political ferment immediately moved into violence.Armed Islamists mounted attacks across Algeria, the security forces fought back; and sometimes it was hard to tell which group had carried out which atrocity.Other states in the region - Tunisia and Morocco, Mauritania to the west and Libya to the east - also battled against Islamists.But the conflict in Algeria was particularly brutal, killing perhaps 150,000 people. It peaked in the 1990s, until an amnesty offer to Islamists in 1999 led to gradual improvements. Violence fell and the country's economy recovered during the early years of the 21st Century.However, the most feared of the militant organisations, the Armed Islamic Group or GIA, rejected the promised amnesty and continued a violent campaign to establish an Islamic state.By then it had split, with the most extreme faction calling itself the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat - a name which echoed an Islamist group in Morocco. The Arabic word \"Salafist\" means fundamentalist, in the sense of going back to the original texts of Islam.In September 2006 the GSPC said it had joined forces with al-Qaeda, and in January 2007 it announced that it had changed its name to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb to reflect its new allegiance.At the time there had been much debate in intelligence circles about the significance of the move. Some officials dismissed it as an act of desperation by a group on its last legs, seeking to attract new recruits by aligning itself with Osama Bin Laden.Others, who saw it as far more worrying development, proved correct, as al-Qaeda has succeeded in persuading North Africa's Islamist extremists to take a more global view. In fact, the head of the US Africa Command said he believed that in 2012 AQIM, Nigeria's Boko Haram and the Somali Islamist group al-Shabab were co-ordinating their efforts.The merger announcement delighted al-Qaeda's then deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who described it at the time as \"a source of chagrin, frustration and sadness\" for Algeria's authorities.Shortly afterwards, seven bombs exploded in Algeria's eastern Kabylia region, killing six people, and in April 2007 at least 30 people were killed in bomb attacks on official buildings in Algiers. AQIM said it had planted the bombs.More attacks followed: on buses carrying foreign oil workers; on American diplomats; on soldiers; and in September 2007, a suicide bomb attack in Batna, aimed at the motorcade of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The president was not injured, but 20 people were killed.Two days later, a car bomb killed more than 30 people at a coastguard barracks in the town of Dellys. In December, twin car bombs claimed by AQIM killed at least 37 people in Algiers, including 17 UN staff.The death toll continued to mount in 2008.Back-to-back attacks on 19 and 20 August killed dozens of people. The first was a suicide car bombing at a police college in Issers, east of Algiers, killing 48 people. A day later, two more car bombings struck in quick succession in Bouira, south-east of Algiers. The second explosion in Bouira killed 12 Algerian employees of the Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.The attacks continued into 2009, when suspected al-Qaeda militants in February killed nine security guards who were working for the state-owned gas and electricity distributor Sonelgaz at a camp near Jijel, east of Algiers.Algerian Islamists represent the largest national grouping in al-Qaeda, according to Jill Carroll's 2007 briefing paper How Did Al-Qaeda Emerge in North Africa?Abdelaziz Belkhadem, Algeria's prime minister in 2007, warned that the bombers wanted to take the North African country back to \"the years of hardship\". But other incidents across the Maghreb pointed to the group's regional ambitions.In January that year, 12 people were shot dead by the security forces in Tunisia near the small town of Solimane, south of the capital, Tunis.The authorities initially described their adversaries as criminals but later admitted that the men were Islamist militants with connections to the GSPC.Meanwhile, Morocco's security forces clamped down on several militant cells - arresting, trying and jailing their leaders - after four incidents blamed on al-Qaeda-inspired groups in 2007.The security forces were said to be on the lookout for militants who were believed to be crossing into Morocco from Algeria.And of course the Madrid train bombs, which killed almost 200 people in 2004, were the work of a Moroccan gang.In December 2008, AQIM militants abducted the United Nations special envoy, Robert Fowler, and his assistant, Louis Guay, near Niger's capital, Niamey. They were released in April 2009.The group also seized four European tourists who disappeared in January 2009 along the Mali-Niger border. Two were freed in April.The group threatened to kill one of the remaining pair - a Briton - unless a radical Islamic cleric convicted of terrorism in Jordan, Abu Qatada, was released from jail in the UK.And in June 2009 the British government said it believed AQIM's claims on an Islamist website that the death threat had been carried out against the British captive, Edwin Dyer.In July 2010 AQIM said it had killed French hostage Michel Germaneau - kidnapped in northern Niger three months earlier and transferred to Mali - in revenge for the killing of seven comrades in a failed rescue raid.In November 2011 a German was killed and three other foreigners kidnapped by AQIM in the ancient tourist city of Timbuktu in northern Mali.The group is thought to have between 600 and 800 fighters spread throughout Algeria and Europe - and according to the independent think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, most of its major commanders trained in Afghanistan.Since 2004, the leader of the militants is thought to be Abou Mossab Abdelwadoud, a former university science student and infamous bomb-maker.In 2005, deputy GSPC leader Amari Saifi was sentenced to life in prison by an Algiers court for kidnapping 32 European tourists in 2003.The former paratrooper was captured by Chadian rebels in mysterious circumstances and passed on to Libya before standing trial in Algeria.Another leading member was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, known as \"The One-Eyed\", a former soldier and infamous cigarette smuggler at the centre of the 2013 hostage drama in Algeria. He left AQIM in late 2012 after falling out with some leaders and has been involved in operations in Mali.He organised the importation of arms for the underground network from Niger and Mali. He is wanted in Algeria on terrorism charges.\n"," Al-Qaeda in the Land of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), to give its full name in English, has its roots in the bitter Algerian civil war of the early 1990s, but has since evolved to take on a more international Islamist agenda.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 290 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 91.0435606956482  min ---  5462.613659143448  sec ---\n","Racism in football has hit the headlines at Premiership level recently, but a BBC Wales investigation indicates it's also a feature of the amateur and grassroots game in Wales.Teams from black and ethnic minority communities have told Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme of the comments, abuse and hostility they say they encounter at some matches, from players, spectators and even match officials.There have been a number of racial incidents at football matches in Wales over the past year, including last April when a linesman at a Welsh League game between Cwmbran Town FC and Grange Harlequins FC, from Cardiff, was disciplined by the Football Association of Wales for a comment made to a player.He was fined Â£750 and banned from the Cwmbran Town ground for five months.And last August, Pontypridd team Graig FC were disciplined by the South Wales Football Association for misconduct after supporters of the side were racially abusive towards visiting STM Sports FC, from Llanrumney, Cardiff.Mohamed Dualeh, secretary and manager of Tiger Bay FC, made up of predominantly Somali players from south Cardiff, told the programme of an incident in a game in which his team played.\"The team that we were playing, one of our players was involved in a rough challenge.

If he had been convicted, Bogdanov could have been jailed for up to three years.Written by the playwright Howard Brenton, The Romans in Britain, which opened in London in October 1980, was always likely to provoke controversy.With vivid imagery, strong language and violence, the play sought to draw graphic parallels between the Romans' invasion of the British Isles and the presence at the time of British soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland.But it was one short scene involving the attempted rape of a young Druid called Marban by a Roman soldier (\"a metaphor for the rape of one culture by another,\" according to the director), that eventually landed Bogdanov in court.When he was first handed the play by the National's then artistic director, Sir Peter Hall, Bogdanov says he thought it contained some of the best new writing he had read. The attempted rape scene, to be performed with naked actors in full light and centre-stage, was \"brilliantly written\".But though nudity was not uncommon on the stage - and Bogdanov was careful that no sexual contact was actually made between the actors (the Roman used his bunched up fist and thumb as a substitute for his erect penis) - Sir Peter was clearly worried. He asked Bogdanov to consider moving the scene upstage, in half light.The director stood his ground, arguing the scene's artistic merit. Sir Peter eventually acceded, but not before warning that there could be trouble ahead.Though playing to packed audiences, the play's nudity and strong language attracted fervent media attention. But more ominously, it quickly came to the notice of Mrs Whitehouse, then head of the National Viewers and Listeners' Association.She refused to attend a performance in person but in December 1980 sent her solicitor to watch the play in order to collect evidence. He came back convinced there had been a sexual act on stage likely to cause offence.Listen to the programmeDownload the podcastHaving tried and failed to force the Attorney General to initiate a prosecution against the National, the morality campaigner then began her own proceedings under the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, accusing Bogdanov of being the \"pimp\" who had allegedly procured the act on stage.Three decades on, Bogdanov's memories of those days are still vivid. He and his colleagues had initially dismissed the possibility of being taken to court, believing their defence of dramatic effect would be enough to discourage a prosecution. But a magistrate and then an Old Bailey judge both ruled that the case should be heard.Bogdanov became increasingly concerned: \"I can't pretend it was easy, it felt like some huge juggernaut rolling over me, especially when they spent hours discussing whether I should be kept in the cells overnight,\" he says.Anonymous letters arrived at the family home, while his children became the object of unwanted attention at school. \"At one point I was the only thing on the front pages.\"The collapse of Bogdanov's trial three days after it began was one more act in the long-running drama of The Romans in Britain.Keen to establish what Mrs Whitehouse's solicitor, and chief prosecution witness, had actually seen on stage, Bogdanov's defence team asked him to tell the jury where he had been sitting in the theatre. \"At the back,\" came the answer - much to everyone's amazement.Lord Hutchinson, lead defence counsel, leapt up: \"What if I told you that what you thought you saw was not an erect penis, but a thumb?\" And he proceeded to bunch up his fist and thumb under his robes, pulling them aside to reveal his hand to the witness and jury.Bogdanov, looking on from the dock, says members of the jury burst out laughing, while the prosecution barrister went pale and immediately requested an adjournment. The prosecution withdrew its evidence, and the court set Bodganov free.Outside the court, Mrs Whitehouse claimed victory. The case, she said, had set an important legal precedent that the Sexual Offences Act could be applied to events on stage and that simulated sex could amount to gross indecency.But for Bogdanov, the play that got him into trouble has left other lessons. The Romans in Britain, he says, is just one in a long line of stage productions down the years that have caused controversy.\"The thing that gives me most pleasure is that the theatre still has the power to shock,\" he says.Mike Lanchin spoke to Michael Bogdanov for the BBC World Service programme Witness.

After a period of turmoil following World War I, an independent kingdom of Hungary was established under the authoritarian regency of Admiral Miklos Horthy.The redrawing of European borders that took place after World War I left about five million ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. Their status remains a sensitive issue and has complicated Hungary's relations with its neighbours.Following World War II, in which Admiral Horthy had allied himself with Germany, Hungary fell under communist rule. An uprising in 1956 was crushed by Red Army forces, but Hungary did later become the first Eastern European country to gain some economic freedom.Hungary played an important part in accelerating the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe when it opened its border with Austria in 1989, allowing thousands of East Germans to escape to the West. Just a few months later the Berlin Wall was history.Hungary's post-communist economic transition was achieved relatively smoothly. Within four years of the collapse of communism nearly half of the country's economic enterprises had been transferred to the private sector, and by 1998 Hungary was attracting nearly half of all foreign direct investment in Central Europe.Ten years later, the picture looked rather less rosy. A high level of both private and state borrowing left the country particularly vulnerable to the credit crunch of 2008, and in October of that year the government was forced to appeal to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank for massive loans in a bid to stave off economic collapse.Dissatisfaction with the centre-left coalition government's handling of the economy from 2002 to 2010 coincided with the rise of the right-wing nationalist party Jobbik, known for its anti-Semitic and anti-Gypsy rhetoric, and a move to the authoritarian right by the Fidesz party, which won parliamentary elections in 2010 and 2014.The two-thirds parliamentary majority gained by Fidesz in 2010 allowed it to throw out the comparatively liberal post-communist constitution and replace it with a constitution that critics say cements the governing party's hold on power and removes checks and balances essential for the healthy functioning of a democracy. Fidesz insists that the constitutional change was necessary in order to complete the work of eradicating the legacy of communism.Fidesz scored another comfortable victory in the 2014 election, albeit with a reduced majority. Jobbik increased its share of the vote, becoming the second-largest political party in the country.\n"," Hungary traces its history back to the Magyars, an alliance of semi-nomadic tribes from southern Russia and the Black Sea coast that arrived in the region in the ninth century.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 297 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 93.49135901530583  min ---  5609.481542825699  sec ---\n","870s - First Norse settlements on Iceland.

Doubly so when it affects a sports star like 23-year-old Fabrice Muamba.He is said to be one of the fittest players at his club, Bolton Wanderers.The same sentiments were expressed about Marc-Vivien Foe, the Cameroon footballer who collapsed and died during an international match in 2003.But the underlying cause of such deaths are likely to be inherited rather than a reflection on their fitness.Genetic abnormalities are usually associated with arrhythmias - irregular heart beats - or cardiomyopathies, which is a disease of the heart muscle.But where sport can play a role is on the likelihood of these conditions leading to a cardiac arrest.The evidence is not clear-cut.But research has suggested that those with inherited conditions are twice as likely to suffer a cardiac arrest if they play sport at a high level.Dr Leonard Shapiro, a consultant cardiologist and medical adviser to the Football Association, says it is always difficult to know exactly what triggers the attack.But he says: \"There is a predisposition in some individuals to have a cardiac event under very high physical and emotional stress.\"The question that is always asked after such events is whether anything can be done to prevent them.Many sports in Britain regularly screen top athletes, although it is not mandatory as it is in some countries such as Italy.In football, players are checked at 16 and then are likely to have regular check-ups as their career goes on.Those that are diagnosed with a problem often have to give up top-level sport.Sports cardiologist Sanjay Sharma, who also works for the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young, says the tests are thorough, but not perfect.\"It involves taking a history relating to cardiac symptoms, which include chest pain during exertion or breath which is disproportionate to the amount of exercise being performed, and blackouts, and asking about a family history because many of these conditions that can cause cardiac arrest are hereditary.\"We then perform a cardiac examination and following that we do an ECG (electrocardiogram), which is an electrical tracing of the heart which looks for electric faults of the heart, and a cardiac ultrasound, which looks at heart muscle problems or problems with the heart valves.\"However, they do not guarantee that an abnormality will be picked up.The difficulty is that such abnormalities are not always permanent.They can come and go - as the Muamba case suggests. It has been reported that the Bolton player had four such screenings during his career, the latest of which was done last summer.\n"," Most people associate heart problems - and cardiac arrest in particular - with older people.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 302 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 95.39354449907938  min ---  5723.612672567368  sec ---\n","Staff Sgt Robert Bales, who was sent to Iraq three times before his recent deployment to Afghanistan, returned to the United States on Friday.His lawyer, John Henry Browne, has said the accused could be suffering from PTSD.Talk to people who live around the sprawling military base of Fort Lewis-McChord - one of the largest in America and home to more than 100,000 personnel, including Sgt Bales - and you will find they know all about post-traumatic stress disorder.As the population of this base in the north-western state of Washington has grown - and war zone deployments have increased - so too has the amount of suicide and violence.Last year, the military newspaper Stars and Stripes labelled Lewis-McChord the \"most troubled\" base in the US military.But it is claimed that cases of PTSD were not just being overlooked - they may actually have been deliberately downplayed.At the base's Madigan Army Medical Center, an investigation is currently under way into allegations that the diagnoses of hundreds of soldiers suffering from PTSD may have been altered to lesser conditions in order to save on disability costs paid by the army.Seattle-based mental health therapist and PTSD counsellor Reid Stell says: \"A PTSD diagnosis never goes away. To say you're curedâ€¦ that would be overly optimistic.\"As to whether Sgt Robert Bales could have had his diagnosis altered in such a way, a US military spokeswoman told the BBC in a statement that they keep service members' health information private and do not comment on medical records.Navy veteran Matt Bambara, 29, volunteers at a cafe, Coffee Strong, near the Lewis-McChord base.He told the BBC he believes many problems in the community have been caused by people with untreated cases of PTSD.\"The military ought to be held accountable for the health and well-being of soldiers,\" Mr Bambara said.The words \"war is trauma\" are painted on a wall of Coffee Strong, and Mr Bambara says he witnesses PTSD behaviour among some of his customers.\"People come in with high levels of anxiety,\" he says. \"You can almost see it in their face in terms of the way they are looking over their shoulders and constantly looking out of the window and are just kind of generally suspicious and just distrustful.\"Is the military doing enough?\"I don't think they are,\" he says. \"I don't think they have the capacity.\"The fact is they wouldn't be able to function and perform their mission if they were to genuinely compensate and allow the proper healing to take place.\"Dr Harry Croft, former Army doctor and psychiatrist, who has evaluated more than 7,000 veterans for PTSD, says the rampage in Afghanistan means it is time for the military to take a closer look at the impact on soldiers who serve multiple tours.A study in 2008 by RAND Corp, a think tank, indicated that 18% of all service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001 had PTSD or major depression. Only about half were seeking help.\"They're reluctant for fear that it could affect their military career,\" says Mr Stell, on why so few soldiers reach out for PTSD and depression treatment.Others say PTSD is too often used as a diagnosis or as an \"excuse\".\"Some people say PTSD because it's an easy diagnosis, in my opinion,\" says Steve Binda, 67, a retired US Army veteran who served in Vietnam.He says men he knew fought in the trenches and survived the horrors of World War II, coming back home to continue on with their lives post-war.Sue Rothwell, 63, owner of Gerties, a local restaurant and bar popular among the soldiers and veterans, isn't surprised that some soldiers snap.\"You take an 18-year-old off a farm in Minnesota, for example, send them over there and then wonder why he can't deal with it,\" she says.In January 2010, US soldier Joshua Tabor was convicted of assault after holding his four-year-old daughter's head under water when she could not remember her alphabet properly.In April 2011, Sgt David Stewart, a medic assigned to the Lewis-McChord base killed himself and his wife after leading authorities on a high-speed car chase.They subsequently found the couple's five-year-old son dead at their home.Last week, Lt Col Robert Underwood, a national guard trainer, was charged with allegedly hiring a hit man to kill his wife and his superior officer. He also threatened to blow up the Washington state capitol.All three men in these cases were said to have been suffering PTSD, and all were based at Lewis-McChord.Will anything come of the recent killing and maiming of 16 civilians in Afghanistan?Some mental health experts are sceptical.Mr Stell worries that the incident will be brushed off as the actions of a rogue soldier.\"This is what it takes,\" he says. \"A big headline-grabbing event, but will it be the bad apple argument.\"\n"," As a US soldier is held for the massacre of 16 Afghan civilians, there are growing concerns at his home base about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n","\n","Predicting summary for 303 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 95.77420962254206  min ---  5746.452579021454  sec ---\n","Zhou Youguang helped invent Pinyin, a writing system that turns Chinese characters into words using letters from the Roman alphabet.This makes it easier to learn how to pronounce Chinese words, and is credited with helping raise literacy rates in China.Despite his achievements, Mr Zhou remains largely unknown in his home country.Perhaps that is because the 106-year-old is a defiant character, refusing to take much credit for his work or pander to the Chinese Communist Party.He is critical of the party that governs China - and old enough not to care who is listening to what he has to say.\"What are they going to do, come and take me away?\" he said in an interview with the BBC in his sparsely furnished Beijing home.Positive outlookMr Zhou's life has coincided with most of the momentous events of China's recent history, as it has moved from imperial dynasty to peoples' republic to capitalist powerhouse.He was born in 1906 into a wealthy family that managed to lose its money three times: first in the Qing dynasty, then during World War II and finally during the Cultural Revolution, a political campaign launched by Mao Zedong.Nevertheless, he managed to get a good education, studying economics at St John's University, one of the best educational institutions in Shanghai in the 1920s when he was there.Several years of his early life were spent working in the US for a Chinese bank. \"It was at No 1 Wall Street - the centre of imperialism,\" he said, laughing.Mr Zhou laughs a lot, a result of an optimistic outlook. \"There are good aspects to even bad things,\" he said.That does not mean everything in the centenarian's life has gone his way.His daughter died of appendicitis just before her sixth birthday and, like many intellectuals, he was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.A common form of punishment at the time - in the late 1960s - was to send educated city professionals to the countryside to \"learn from the masses\".Mr Zhou spent several years working in the fields of Ningxia, a poor region in western China.\"It was a waste of time and stopped me doing other things,\" he said, unable to stop himself laughing again.Despite hardships, Mr Zhou did have one enormous stroke of luck.When the Communist Party took over in China in 1949, he was in the US. He decided to return, along with many others, to build a new country.He initially become an economics professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, but in 1955 was invited to join a committee in Beijing looking at simplifying the Chinese language.At first he resisted, saying he had no professional experience in this field. He was finally persuaded to join the project by a friend.It was a decision that probably saved his life.A few years later, Chairman Mao launched one of his first purges, and many of those caught in the mayhem were those who had gone back to China from abroad.\"All university professors who'd returned from the US were labelled 'Rightists'. Many committed suicide, including some good friends. I luckily missed it,\" he said.It was one of the few moments that Mr Zhou did not laugh.Dark future?The work he did on the committee not only saved him, it allowed him to make a major contribution to the Chinese language.When he started work on developing Pinyin, 85% of Chinese people could not read or write. Now, that is just a few percent.There had been previous attempts to Romanise Chinese characters, but the system developed by Mr Zhou and his colleagues is the one that most people now use, and is recognised internationally.\"We spent three years developing pinyin. People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters,\" he said.Having lived so long and done such high-profile work, the linguist has met more than his fair share of historical characters.One of his favourite stories is about Puyi, China's last emperor, who became an ordinary citizen under Chairman Mao.Mr Zhou once belonged to a Chinese body that advises the government, work that allowed him to dine at the organisation's canteen in Beijing.During one of the country's periodic food shortages, he ate there daily, taking his wife along too. This meant more food at home for Mr Zhou's relatives.\"Everyday when I went to eat, there was an old man sitting next to me. He was also there with his wife,\" he said.\"It was Puyi - the last emperor. Imagine, even the emperor had to eat there because he didn't have enough food.\"Mr Zhou's age has also given him a long view of history. He believes the Chinese Communist Party will not always rule the country.\"China will have to release itself from communism. The future will be dark if it doesn't,\" said Mr Zhou, who retired at 85, but is still writing books.It is a damning comment from a man who came back to China because he believed the Communist Party when its leaders said they were democratic.Does he ever regret that decision?\"We believed Mao's words. We didn't know that when he got into power he would become the worst kind of dictator,\" said Mr Zhou.\"But I don't regret coming back - there's no point,\" he added, laughing again.\n"," Students struggling to learn Chinese might not know it, but their task has been made easier because of the work of one man.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 304 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 96.24218468268712  min ---  5774.531083583832  sec ---\n","Doctors say it is too early to predict whether he will play football again.But Dr Tobin said he is amazed by the 23-year-old's recovery so far.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIn an emotional interview, Dr Tobin said: \"It was 48 minutes when he collapsed to reaching hospital and a further 30 minutes after that.

Over time, its focus has switched to the developing world.The World Bank's predecessor - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - was set up to drive post-war recovery.Now, it is the world's leading development organisation, working for growth and poverty reduction.Owned by the governments of its 187 member states, the Bank channels loans and grants and advises low and middle-income countries.The IMF is funded by a charge - known as a \"quota\" - paid by member nations. The quota is based on a country's wealth and it determines voting power within the organisation; those making higher contributions have greater voting rights.The IMF acts as a lender of last resort, disbursing its foreign exchange reserves for short periods to any member in difficulties.Since they were conceived, the IMF has been run by a European and the World Bank by a US national.The IMF and the Bank have served as a rallying point for disparate causes - from environmentalists to anarchists - and meetings have occasionally been accompanied by violent street protests.Protesters and critics cite the exploitation of the poor and the environment and argue that freer trade threatens the livelihoods of millions of people.The IMF has admitted that forcing developing countries to open their markets to foreign investors can increase the risk of financial crises.Its former managing director Horst Koehler said in 2002 that the benefits of globalisation had not been equally shared. But he added that \"the objective should not be less globalisation but more and better globalisation.\"Conceived: Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USADate: 1944Headquarters:  Washington DCIMF-World Bank membership: 187 countriesWorld Bank staff: 10,000IMF staff: 2,500IMF managing director: Christine LagardeChristine Lagarde is the first woman to head the IMF in the 65 years of the organisation's history.She trained as a lawyer and for more than two decades worked for a Chicago-based international law firm, where she specialised in major labour and anti-trust cases.She served as French trade minister from 2005 to 2007, when she was made finance minister, becoming the first woman to hold such a post in any of the G8 major industrial countries.Ms Lagarde took over the helm of the IMF in July 2011 at a time when the organisation was facing some extremely tough challenges, with the eurozone in a state of deep crisis and fears looming that countries such as Greece could default on their loans.Never afraid of speaking her mind, she has blamed the 2008 worldwide financial crisis partly on the male-dominated, testosterone-fuelled culture at global banks.She is viewed with high regard in the international arena and in 2009 was named best finance minister in Europe by the Financial Times.She has pledged to improve diversity at the IMF and to push ahead with reforms to give emerging economies more influence in the organisation.She took over after the previous head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had to resign over charges of sexual assault. He has subsequently been cleared.World Bank president: Jim Yong KimJim Yong Kim was chosen as the new president of the World Bank in April 2012.The Korean-American health expert was president of Dartmouth College in the US state of New Hampshire.He faced a strong challenge for the post, which has traditionally gone to an American, from Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.Dr Kim succeeded Robert Zoellick is serving a five-year term.Jim Yong Kim is a doctor lauded for his pioneering role in treating HIV/Aids and reducing the impact of tuberculosis in the developing world.The IMF and World Bank attempt to help countries or regions in economic turmoil - and often act as a lender of last resort for nation-states.Past interventions by the IMF have included providing funds for countries caught up in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and loans to help South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil stave off debt default crises.In October 2008, the IMF activated an emergency funding scheme for countries facing economic distress resulting from the global financial crisis.As of August 2010, it had committed around $200bn in lending to a number of economies affected by the crisis. The biggest borrowers then were Hungary, Romania and Ukraine.The recent eurozone crisis also triggered extensive IMF intervention, including hefty bailouts for countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland in tandem with the European Union.It is currently contributing to the second international bailout of Greece, and discussing further loans to Hungary.The IMF can also grant emergency loans following natural disasters; these have included the 2004 Asian tsunami.Developing countries have voiced dissatisfaction with what they say is their lack of influence in the IMF and World Bank.This includes the so-called Bric countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China - whose economic power has grown significantly.They have called for changes to the quota system in which votes in the IMF are weighted in line with member nations' financial contributions.Under this system, the US has 17% of the vote in the IMF, whereas India, with more than three times the population of the US, has less than one third. And because constitutional changes in the IMF require 85% of the vote, the US has a veto.The long-standing arrangement under which the IMF is usually led by a European, while the World Bank is led by an American, has also been called into question.Ms Lagarde quickly appointed Zhu Min - a former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China - to the newly created post of deputy managing director when she took over.\n"," The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and what is now known as the World Bank,  were set up to manage the post-World War II global economy.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 307 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 97.27858264446259  min ---  5836.714960575104  sec ---\n","The Office for National Statistics experts base their projections on current and future survival trends.And if their calculations are borne out, more than 95,000 of those who turn 65 this year can expect to celebrate their 100th birthday in 2047.The number of centenarians has been steadily increasing - from 600 in 1961 to nearly 13,000 in 2010.In 2012, the figure is expected to hit 14,500, and by 2035 will have breached the 100,000 mark.And more of these will be women than men.In 2012 there are 826,000 babies aged under one year.

check the competency of their drivers.The toxicology report on Mr Baker, seen by 5 Live Investigates, shows cannabis was found in a blood sample.However, because of a delay in blood sampling the toxicologist was unable to say whether or not he was under the influence at the time of the incident.He was jailed for 14 months after admitting one count of death by dangerous driving because it was not known whether or not the cannabis played any part in the accident.Mrs Willis said she is angry that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did not feel it was in the public interest to pursue the

have to pay Nottingham City Council £288 a year per space under the Workplace Parking Levy.Many employers have decided to pass on some or all of the charge to their staff while some have reduced their numbers of car parking spaces.Bristol City Council is considering a similar scheme.The Nottingham scheme will raise £2m less than the council predicted because employers have registered fewer spaces than expected.Among the employees avoiding the charge is Kofi Ohene-Djan from the Capital FM Arena.\"I'm going to be cycling in,\" he said.\"I live in Nottingham so I'm going to be on my bike.\"Mr Ohene-Djan's colleagues have been given the option of paying their employer £52 per year for a parking permit.The arena will pay the remainder of the Workplace Parking Levy, which rises to £380 by 2015.Motoring organisations the AA and the RAC both predicted that the scheme will damage the economy.AA president Edmund King said: \"At a time when drivers are facing record prices at the pumps, further charges for parking at work are the last thing they need.\"This damaging 'tax on work' should be stopped from spreading elsewhere as it will damage the economy and hit employees who just can't afford it.\"Mr Ohene-Djan was asked if he wanted to pay for a permit when he started his job last month.\"I probably would have done a bit of both [cycling and driving] but I will definitely be on my bike now,\" he said.Employers exempt from paying the levy include the Best Western Hotel, on Mansfield Road, Carrington.General manager Phil Rea said: \"We are not affected because it only affects staff parking.\"At any one time I don't have more than seven staff cars on the car park.\"Employers have had to register spaces from 1 October, but charging was timed to begin from this financial year.The council has introduced the levy to pay for transport improvements, including the extension of Nottingham's tram network.Councillor Jane Urquhart, who is in charge of transport, said the council still expected to meet its target over the 23-year period of the levy, generating an average of £14m a year.It will raise £8m this year rather than the £10m expected.Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \"The council blames commuters for Nottingham's congestion, but people travelling in to the city to work make it the prosperous place it is.\"Officials

Scottish cycling talent acknowledge the fabulous contribution made to Scottish and British cycling by Millar, who was born in Glasgow in 1958.His fourth-placed finish in the 1984 Tour de France was a record for a British rider and has since been matched only by Bradley Wiggins in 2009.For three of the organisers, the sportive is the perfect way to celebrate Millar's achievements. They hope it will safeguard his legacy.Billy Bilsland, Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene.Millar was a pupil of Bilsland's at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s.A veteran of the professional continental racing circuit, Bilsland and fellow Glasgow Wheelers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France.Smith, now manager of the Endura racing team, trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe.He picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong.He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut.\"Didn't I see you win the Glasgow-Dunoon race in the '80s?\" I wondered.Smith, from Paisley and now based in Kent, replied that he had indeed won, aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-mile section.Media playback is not supported on this deviceLang, who captains Millar's former club, the Glasgow Wheelers, said: \"In my opinion, he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced.\"Yet I'm sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is, most Glaswegians wouldn't know.\"So we looked at the possibility of setting up a sportive in Robert's honour.\"He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road, between Lennoxtown and Fintry, and that is the final climb.\"The circuit also goes over the Tak Me Doon from Kilsyth, which is tough as well.\"Millar's steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France, as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain (twice) and Italy.And then there were apparent contradictions: self-deprecating and shy or self-assured; pony-tailed waif or tough as teak; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - \"the Caledonian antisyzygy\" on two wheels.Lang put it thus: \"Robert was very much a loner. He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn't really matter who he upset to get there.\"Bilsland, to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains polka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop, added: \"Robert was special.\"He was focused on what he was about. He believed in himself. When he attacked, he attacked to win.\"I think he was one of the few Scotsmen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L'Equipe.\"I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now, he would have won the Tour.Media playback is not supported on this device\"When he was with Peugeot, a lot of the French guys didn't want to ride for him. A lot of the victories he got on his own merit.\"The sportive, Lang believes, is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event.The intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheelers' development squad for young riders and the Braveheart Fund, which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists' prospects.\"He was one of my idols,\" said Smith. \"He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow. Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey.\"I was fortunate then; I was just as small as him so I could use them.\"And now, to have a Robert Millar Sportive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on.\"Every hill that you go over will remind you how difficult it was to become King of the Mountains in the biggest annual sporting event in the world.\"\n"," A generation after Robert Millar mesmerised British TV viewers with his assaults on Pyrenean peaks in mid-1980s Tours de France, a sportive in his honour will test riders on the roads on which he trained.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 313 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 98.79177720546723  min ---  5927.506634473801  sec ---\n","It is estimated that we receive a staggering three billion cold calls from telemarketing companies a year.The Citizens Advice Bureau is getting a growing number of complaints from the public about cold calling and companies' techniques.A BBC One current affairs documentary would like to hear about your experiences.

which are in fact quite legal - have taken a very dim view of all this.Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network said the government had turned a blind eye to this sort of thing and was even encouraging it.\"I severely criticise our tax authorities for putting up with this sort of arrangement,\" he said.\"It is part of our \"open for business\" agenda - we will let a multinational company do what it likes, so long as they put some jobs in the UK, but we won't ask for tax.\"In fact, HMRC has long had a specialist unit of 1,200 tax inspectors dealing just with the affairs of the 770 biggest companies.It is called the Large Business Service for firms with a turnover of Â£600mn or more, or assets of Â£2bn or more.\"We can't discuss Amazon for legal reasons, but HMRC applies the tax laws as they apply to multinationals so the UK receives the tax revenues to which it is legally entitled,\" HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said.\"Where there is a high risk of the UK losing out, we move our resources to challenge that risk,\" it added.When it comes to multinationals and tax authorities arguing about how much tax should be paid, and to whom, the arguments often last for years, frequently hinging on a concept known as transfer pricing.This occurs when a division of a multinational in one country charges a division of the same firm in another country for the supply of a product or a service.This is sometimes criticised as a technique in which artificially high charges are levied internally, with the aim of siphoning money from a firm's business in a high-tax country to a low-tax one.There is nothing new in this problem and the issue hit the headlines in the UK as far back as the 1970s.There is now a lot of legislation to stop transfer pricing being abused, but in the end, there may be no right answer to how much tax is owed by a firm, and a settlement can all come down to haggling.One tax adviser at a leading firm of accountants - who wished to remain anonymous - said it was wrong to suggest the UK tax authorities were just sitting on their hands, watching taxable income move abroad.\"There are some very bright people at HMRC scrutinising these sorts of things, it is wrong to assume we are lax at policing this.\"Another commonplace technique for multinationals to lower their tax bills - a variation on the transfer pricing theme - is for the head office in one country to charge all the national subsidiaries a large fee for \"management services\", such as accounting.If the fee is legitimate, then it is an allowable expense and can be set against a national division's profits to reduce its tax bill, while cash is transferred from that outpost to the head office.Ronnie Ludwig, a tax adviser at Edinburgh accountants Saffery Champness, says the arrangement is commonplace.\"It is perfectly legal for a company to levy a management fee on a subsidiary,\" he says.\"The question is whether it is proportionate and reasonable in relation to the actual services provided - the companies will be asked by the HMRC exactly what they are doing to justify the fees,\" he added.For its part, Amazon says in its accounts that it may have to pay an extra $1.5bn in back taxes in the US if it loses various transfer pricing disputes with the tax authorities there, going back to 2005.Amazon's accounts, filed at the United States chief financial regulator, theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also make it clear that is facing investigations of some sort from several other national tax authorities.\"We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom [and France],\" the accounts say.As a result, the company has set aside $229m to pay any extra tax bills that may now arise from these.\"Everyone of these jurisdictions is going to be very jealous of its entitlements to get tax,\" says Philip Spencer, a tax partner at accountants BDO.\"It is commonplace to have lots of investigations on the go at any one time.\"Multinational firms will inevitably look for a good central site to administer their businesses in a region, not just for a low-tax regime, but to get good staff and enjoy good communications.It all makes life easier.Philip Spencer at BDO points out that a key advantage of a country like Luxembourg is that it also has a good network of double-taxation treaties with other countries.These regulate the taxation of cash flowing from business activity in one country to another.\"Luxembourg is very favourable, it has lots of these treaties, which help avoid having to pay tax in one country and then reclaim it if tax is also levied in a second country.\"A key feature in all this is that the internationalisation of business has been give a huge boost by the advent of the internet and online trading.And this has made life increasingly hard for national tax authorities to deal with.\"What everyone is grappling with is e-commerce,\" says John Whiting, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT).\"Everyone can see that firms like Amazon are making a shedload of profits - the question is where the profits were made.\"\n"," Has the giant online retailer Amazon managed, quite legally, to avoid paying any corporation tax at all to the UK in the past year?\n","\n","Predicting summary for 316 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 100.15776882568996  min ---  6009.466131448746  sec ---\n","Photos on the internet appear to show Diouf in a nightclub, just hours before the match at Southampton on 24 March.\"I've made some inquiries and I've asked him about it and he denies he was there,\" Saunders told Radio Sheffield.\"It's still ongoing and I want to get to the bottom of it.

either geography or history.Supporters of religious education want to see it included in the humanities category.By Robert PigottReligious affairs correspondent, BBC NewsDuring his decade as leader of the Church of England, Dr Williams has repeatedly complained that Christianity is being marginalised in British public life.Today he welcomed what he said was a reduction in active hostility towards religion, but issued a new warning.It was that \"serious and liberal-minded commentators\" were embracing religion as a socially useful tool - for example for rethinking our \"destructive economic habits\" - but wanted to \"pick out the best bits of religion without all the embarrassing beliefs that go with it\".The archbishop insisted that it was precisely those awkward beliefs - such as the actual resurrection of Jesus - that mattered in Christianity, and that without them it would cease to make sense.His fear is that Christianity might survive the active hostility of atheists, only to succumb to a kind of asset stripping which reduced it to a set of well-meaning principles without really saying anything about God.But the government says it is already a compulsory National Curriculum subject and the English Baccalaureate is to encourage more students to take up geography and history in addition to RE - not instead of it.In his sermon, Dr Williams said: \"There is plenty to suggest that younger people, while still statistically deeply unlikely to be churchgoers, don't have the hostility to faith that one might expect, but at least share some... sense that there is something here to take seriously - when they have a chance to learn about it.\"It is about the worst possible moment to downgrade the status and professional excellence of religious education in secondary schools.\"Dr Williams said a hostility towards faith and religion in public life may have been tempered by a recent appreciation of the social value of religion.But he said the ultimate test of Christianity was not whether it was beneficial to the human race, but whether the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually happened.He said that for Christians a vision of reconciled love between people \"is there only because God raised Jesus\" and that the answer was not in scientific proof, but by the way believers lived with and in their faith.The latest debate on faith in Britain was ignited after Conservative co-chairwoman Baroness Warsi warned that the nation was under threat from a rising tide of \"militant secularisation\".The Muslim peer said in February that Europe needed to become \"more confident and more comfortable in its Christianity\".Research carried out in the same month by a secularist foundation suggested three-quarters of people who describe themselves as Christian in Britain displayed only a low level of belief and practice of the religion.The Ipsos Mori poll, for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, was rubbished by the Church, with Reverend Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, saying it was not fair to trump people's \"self-identification\" as Christians.In his Easter Sunday sermon, Cardinal O'Brien told worshippers to \"wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ\" each day of their lives.He also voiced concern at the growing \"marginalisation\" of religion.Dr Williams also issued a call for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East.He said: \"A visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, will convince you why the state of Israel exists and must go on existing.\"A visit to any border checkpoint will convince you that the daily harassment and humiliation of Palestinians of all ages and backgrounds cannot be a justifiable or even sustainable price to pay for security.\"He said: \"We have to prod and nag and encourage the religious leadership in the Holy Land on all sides to speak as if they believed in a God who acts, not only a God who endorses their version of reality.\"We have to pray, to pray for wisdom and strength and endurance for all who are hungry for peace and justice, pray that people will go on looking for a truly shared future.\"In March, Dr Williams announced he would step down as Archbishop of Canterbury -

which had never before had a female vice-president.Equally surprising was her decision to publicly stand up to her boss - by refusing to endorse his plans for his brother, Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Mutharika, to succeed him as president in 2014 when he was due to retire.She was promptly thrown out of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party - and subjected to daily doses of derision at public rallies and on Malawi's state airwaves.A senior ruling party official openly said Malawi was \"not ready for a female president\", while First Lady Callista Mutharika said Mrs Banda was fooling herself that she was a serious politician - saying she was a mere market woman selling fritters.\"She will never be president, how can a mandasi [fritter] seller be president?\" Mrs Mutharika said.Mrs Banda took all this in her stride, saying she was glad to be identified with market women since more than 80% of Malawian women belong to that category: \"Yes, she's right, I'm indeed a mandasi seller and I'm proud of it because the majority of women in Malawi are like us, mandasi sellers.\"She also resisted calls for her to resign as the country's vice-president - she was elected not appointed so she could not be fired by Mr Mutharika - and instead set up her own People's Party.Born in 1950 in the village of Malemia near the southern town of Zomba, Joyce Hilda Ntila was the eldest in a family of five children.Her father was the leader of Malawi's police brass band and her youngest sister, Anjimile, ran pop star Madonna's charity Raising Malawi until it closed in December.She left her first husband in 1981, taking her three children with her, because he was abusive.\"Most African women are taught to endure abusive marriages. They say endurance means a good wife but most women endure abusive relationship because they are not empowered economically, they depend on their husbands,\" she told the BBC about her decision.Eight years later, Mrs Banda founded the National Association of Business Women, a group that lends start-up cash to small-scale traders - making her popular among Malawi's many rural poor.That work also earned her international recognition - in 1997, she was awarded, along with former Mozambican President Joachim Chissano, the US-based Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger.She also set up the Joyce Banda Foundation, a charity that assists Malawian children and orphans through education - she has a degree in early childhood education.Joyce Banda cut her teeth in politics in 1999 when she won a parliamentary seat on the ticket of the former ruling United Democratic Front.She held a number of cabinet positions under former President Bakili Muluzi and Mr Mutharika during his first term.She puts her achievements down to her happy marriage to retired Chief Justice Richard Banda with whom she has two children.\"My dear husband, Richard, has been the driving force behind my success and rise to whatever level I am now. My story and legacy is incomplete without his mention,\" she said.Mrs Banda's presidential challenges are huge: Aside from handling political divisions and possible opposition from Mr Mutharika's allies, she has to address Malawi's serious economic difficulties.It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 75% of the population living on less than $1 (60p) a day.And former President Mutharika fell out with most of Western donors - on which the country depends for financial support.The cutting off of direct aid resulted in the country's worst shortages of foreign currency, fuel and essential drugs.But she has immediately made her mark - sacking Malawi's police chief Peter Mukhito, accused of mishandling anti-government riots last year in which at least 19 people were shot dead, and Patricia Kaliati as information minister.In the wake of Mr Mutharika's death, Ms Kaliati had held a press conference saying Mrs Banda had no right to take over as president - despite what the constitution said.The head of Malawi's state broadcaster has also been replaced.\n"," Joyce Banda, who has made history becoming Malawi's first female president and only the second woman to lead a country in Africa, has a track record of fighting for women's rights.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 319 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 101.17644022305807  min ---  6070.5864152908325  sec ---\n","The table, published in a report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, showed that US invested more than $48bn (Â£30bn) in the sector, up from $34bn in 2010.China slipped to second place, the authors reported, with investment only increasing by $0.5bn to $45.5bn.Globally, overall financial backing in clean energy technologies hit a record $263bn, up 6.5% from 2010 levels.The report, Who is Winning the Clean Energy Race, showed that G20 nations accounted for 95% of the investment in the sector (which does not include nuclear power).The data, compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, ranked the UK as seventh in the world, with $9.4bn of investment in 2011.Over the course of the year, an additional 83.5 gigawatts (GW) was added to the world's clean energy generation capacity, including almost 30GW of solar and 43GW of wind.\"The sector continues to expand and is outpacing growth in the overall (global) economy.

This close proximity will require the spacecraft to carry a robust shield.\"Heat will be a huge problem,\" says Dr Ralph Cordey, the head of science at Astrium UK.\"If it were not protected, the face of the spacecraft would get as hot as 500 degrees - which would be disastrous.\"We will use a thick heatshield to reduce the temperature within the spacecraft and its systems down to about room temperature so that all the electronics can operate comfortably.\"SolO's remote sensing instruments - its imagers and telescopes - will look though slots which have shutters that can be closed when no observations are being made.The mission is designed to enhance our understanding of how the Sun influences its environment, and in particular how it generates and accelerates the flow of charged particles in which the planets are bathed.This solar wind can be very turbulent, and big eruptions on the solar surface will create major perturbations in the wind. When this stream of particles hits the atmosphere at Earth and the other planets, it triggers spectacular auroral lights.\"Solar Orbiter's mission will tell us how the Sun creates the heliosphere, which you can think of as its atmosphere,\" explained solar physicist Dr Lucie Green from University College London.\"The heliosphere is hot and it expands out into space for about 17 billion km.\"We don't really know how it's formed and how it varies with time, but Solar Orbiter will get really deep into that atmosphere to see where on the surface the emissions are coming from, to ultimately understand how the great bubble is made.\"To sample the solar wind as it comes off the surface, Solar Orbiter has five in-situ instruments.The probe's orbit will also take it high above the plane of the planets so it can see some of the processes at play on the Sun poles. And the speed of SolO around the star means it will be able to follow events and features that would normally rotate out of view of Earth-based observatories.At the heart of the endeavour is a desire to understand better the causes of what solar physicists call \"space weather\".Big storms on the Sun that hurl billions of tonnes of charged particles out into space can disturb electromagnetic fields on Earth, resulting in communications interference and, in extreme cases, damage to power lines and satellite electronics.Scientists would like to be able to forecast such events earlier and with more confidence.Solar Orbiter is a joint venture between Esa and the US space agency (Nasa). The latter will supply one instrument, a sensor and the rocket to send the satellite on its way.The project emerged from a competition among European space scientists to find the most compelling medium-class mission to take an available launch slot at the end of the decade.Esa will soon sign off a second such mission, called Euclid, which will investigate the mysterious phenomena known as dark energy and dark matter, which appear dominate and shape the Universe we see through telescopes.The first in a new class of large missions (those costing a billion euros or more) will be selected next week.

For her, it will take about three weeks.A former event-rider who had competed at the highest level, Claire thought that the Burghley Horse trials, a four-star horse-riding event for top-class riders in Stamford, Lincolnshire, would be her greatest test.\"I didn't think I'd ever get to that level. But the marathon is a bigger challenge. I was wrong.\"In the beginning she could only take two steps. Just a few weeks ago, she could only walk 30, making the marathon a near impossible feat.But Claire's sporting background has provided her with the resilience she needs to keep going. Following gruelling training sessions three times a week at a Yorkshire clinic, she can now cover longer distances of up to a mile in one session.It takes at least two-and-a-half hours for her to complete a mile but she hopes to improve her speed as the weeks pass, staying in a hotel at night-time and starting afresh every morning from the point where she left off the night before.In 2006, Claire's horse Rolled Oats clipped his shoulder, flinging her from the saddle into a nearby tree.

For that, a self-replicating system that does not require the DNA intermediary must be developed.With that in hand, \"construction of genetic systems based on alternative chemical platforms may ultimately lead to the synthesis of novel forms of life\".\n"," Researchers have succeeded in mimicking the chemistry of life in synthetic versions of DNA and RNA molecules.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 330 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 104.86440819899241  min ---  6291.864494085312  sec ---\n","They argue that the total volume of water in aquifers underground is 100 times the amount found on the surface.The team have produced the most detailed map yet of the scale and potential of this hidden resource.Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters, they stress that large scale drilling might not be the best way of increasing water supplies.Across Africa more than 300 million people are said not to have access to safe drinking water.Demand for water is set to grow markedly in coming decades due to population growth and the need for irrigation to grow crops.Freshwater rivers and lakes are subject to seasonal floods and droughts that can limit their availability for people and for agriculture. At present only 5% of arable land is irrigated.When water falls as rain or snow, much of it either flows into rivers or is used to provide moisture to plants and crops. What is left over trickles down to the layers of rock that sit beneath the soil.And just like a giant sponge, this ground water is held in the spaces between the rocks and in the tiny inter-connected spaces between individual grains in a rock like sandstone.These bodies of wet rock are referred to as aquifers. Ground water does not sit still in the aquifer but is pushed and pulled by gravity and the weight of water above it.The movement of the water through the aquifer removes many impurities and it is often cleaner than water on the surface.Now scientists have for the first time been able to carry out a continent-wide analysis of the water that is hidden under the surface in aquifers. Researchers from the British Geological Survey and University College London (UCL)            have mapped in detail the amount and potential yield of this groundwater resource across the continent.Helen Bonsor from the BGS is one of the authors of the paper.

She hopes the new maps will open people's eyes to the potential.\"Where there's greatest ground water storage is in northern Africa, in the large sedimentary basins, in Libya, Algeria and Chad,\" she said.\"The amount of storage in those basins is equivalent to 75m thickness of water across that area - it's a huge amount.\"Due to changes in climate that have turned the Sahara into a desert over centuries many of the aquifers underneath were last filled with water over 5,000 years ago.The scientists collated their information from existing hydro-geological maps from national governments as well as 283 aquifer studies.The researchers say their new maps indicate that many countries currently designated as \"water scarce\" have substantial groundwater reserves.However, the scientists are cautious about the best way of accessing these hidden resources. They suggest that widespread drilling of large boreholes might not work.Dr Alan MacDonald of the BGS, lead author of the study, told the BBC: \"High-yielding boreholes should not be developed without a thorough understanding of the local groundwater conditions.\"Appropriately sited and developed boreholes for low yielding rural water supply and hand pumps are likely to be successful.\"With many aquifers not being filled due to a lack of rain, the scientists are worried that large-scale borehole developments could rapidly deplete the resource.According to Helen Bonsor, sometimes the slower means of extraction can be more efficient.\"Much lower storage aquifers are present across much of sub-Saharan Africa,\" she explained.\"However, our work shows that with careful exploring and construction, there is sufficient groundwater under Africa to support low yielding water supplies for drinking and community irrigation.\"The scientists say that there are sufficient reserves to be able to cope with the vagaries of climate change.\"Even in the lowest storage aquifers in semi arid areas with currently very little rainfall, ground water is indicated to have a residence time in the ground of 20 to 70 years.\" Dr Bonsor said.\"So at present extraction rates for drinking and small scale irrigation for agriculture groundwater will provide and will continue to provide a buffer to climate variability.\"The publication of the new map was welcomed by the UK's secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell.\"This is an important discovery,\" he said. \"This research, which the British Government has funded, could have a profound effect on some of the world's poorest people, helping them become less vulnerable to drought and to adapt to the impact of climate change.\"\n"," Scientists say the notoriously dry continent of Africa is sitting on a vast reservoir of groundwater.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 331 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 105.31901597976685  min ---  6319.140960693359  sec ---\n","Martial music accompanies footage of soldiers, and statements by military commanders reinforce the military mobilization under way on both sides of the border.Meanwhile, online activists within Sudan are using social media to question the official line.State-run Sudan TV is re-running programmes made during the north-south civil war, including a 1990s repeat, \"In The Fields of Sacrifice\".

The footage features PDF \"martyrs\" and archive footage of battles from the long-running civil war.Other footage, broadcast under the title \"The Youth Who Answer The Call To Arms\", urges young men to join up. It features key figures from the ruling National Congress Party (NCP), including the defence minister and Khartoum State governor, who are shown dressed in military fatigues, extolling the virtues of jihad.Unlike its counterpart in South Sudan, Khartoum's official TV is not showing contemporary footage from Heglig. Instead, it relies on archive video from other battlegrounds.

He was working out how long 30-year-olds could expect to live.His findings show men languishing far behind for decades, but now starting to get closer to women. If current trends continue, Prof Mayhew predicts, both sexes could, on average, be living to the age of 87 in 2030.He said: \"What's interesting at the moment is that in the last 20 years or so, male life expectancy at 30 has jumped by about six years and if it jumps by the same amount in the next 20 years it will converge with female life expectancy.\"The reason could be down to men living a healthier lifestyle. \"One of the main reasons, I think, is the trend in the prevalence of smoking. Smoking took off after 1920 in the male population and at its high about 80% of males smoked.\"This was reflected in more divergence in the life expectancy, so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expectancy was about 5.7 years.\"Other factors are thought to be safer, more office-based, jobs. Millions of men used to work in hazardous occupations such as coal mining. Healthcare has meant more men live longer as well. People with heart disease, which is more common in men, can expect to live much longer than they did a few decades ago.By contrast, women started smoking later than men.  , but are falling fast in men.A boy and a girl born on the same day will still not have the same life expectancies, as the study looked only at people who had already reached 30. Boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents.It means that women could still have the edge for some time to come.Prof David Leon, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"In virtually all countries in the world, women do have a slight advantage.\"However, he said the gap was definitely closing in some countries.Countries with lower levels of life expectancy, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, showed very little difference between the genders. This was due to the prevalence of infectious diseases which \"are not picky about men and women\", he said.In countries that had defeated most infectious diseases, such as in Eastern Europe, \"there is a much bigger difference, mostly dominated by lifestyle factors\".At one point in the 1990s, the gap between life expectancies in Russia reached 13 years. Prof Leon said it was an \"absolutely massive\" difference in a \"very gendered society\".In his third class of countries, such as the UK, the gap in life expectancies is starting to narrow.He said: \"Men are getting a bit better behaved and women are adopting male life expectancies.\"\n"," The gap between male and female life expectancy is closing and men could catch up by 2030, according to an adviser for the Office for National Statistics.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 334 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 106.47333552837372  min ---  6388.400134086609  sec ---\n","Microsoft paid more than $1bn for most of AOL's patents, beating rivals reported to have included Facebook.Facebook was sued by Yahoo for patent infringement earlier this year.The social networking site, which is preparing for a stock market listing, also reported a drop in its first quarter profits to $205m from $233m a year earlier.A Facebook lawyer described the deal as: \"Another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests.\"Microsoft bought 925 patents and patent applications from AOL.

had viewed six hours of video testimony from the girl and also had DNA evidence, but decided \"she would not be viewed as a credible witness by a jury\".Hassan and the other man, who cannot be named, have been convicted by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court with seven others, all from Greater Manchester, who groomed young girls for sex by plying them with drink and drugs.The file of the girl's

39% owned by News Corp - is not fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence.Reacting to the report, an Ofcom spokesman said it was \"continuing to assess the evidence - including the new and emerging evidence\" that may assist it in ruling on that issue.The committee of MPs began its inquiry in July 2011 in the wake of fresh revelations about the extent of hacking at the tabloid newspaper, with reported victims including the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and the families of victims of the 7/7 London bombings.It heard evidence from Mr Murdoch and his son James, and has now concluded that the notion that a hands-on proprietor like Rupert Murdoch had \"no inkling\" that wrongdoing was widespread at the News of the World was \"simply not credible\".It noted that the newspaper mogul had \"excellent powers of recall and grasp of detail when it suited him\", and added: \"On the basis of the facts and evidence before the committee, we conclude that, if at all relevant times Rupert Murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone hacking, he turned a blind eye and exhibited wilful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications.\"Tory MPs objected specifically to the line branding Mr Murdoch \"not fit\", with one, Philip Davies, telling a press conference the committee had seen \"absolutely no evidence\" to endorse such a \"completely ludicrous\" conclusion.But Labour MP Tom Watson said \"more than any individual alive\", Mr Murdoch was to blame for phone hacking, and it was right to \"raise the bar\" of the report and make that clear.The committee also criticised three former News International executives - one-time executive chairman Les Hinton, former News of the World editor Colin Myler and former legal manager Tom Crone - accusing them of giving misleading evidence.Mr Myler, who is now editor of the New York Daily News, said he had \"always sought to be accurate and consistent\" when speaking to the committee and stood by his evidence.Mr Hinton said the allegations against him were \"unfounded, unfair and erroneous\".Mr Crone said he accepted there were \"valid criticisms of my conduct in this matter\", but he was \"the subject of serious allegations which lack foundation\".News Corp as a whole was guilty of \"huge failings of corporate governance\" and, throughout, its instinct had been \"to cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing and discipline the perpetrators\", the committee said.And it concluded: \"Corporately, the News of the World and News International misled the committee about the true nature and extent of the internal investigations they professed to have carried out in relation to phone hacking; by making statements they would have known were not fully truthful; and by failing to disclose documents which would have helped expose the truth.\"James Murdoch told the committee last summer that he did not see an email which suggested that hacking was more widespread at the paper than previously acknowledged - a claim disputed by Mr Myler and Mr Crone in their evidence.On that matter, the report concluded that James Murdoch was \"consistent\" in relation to the so-called \"For Neville\" email, but he had demonstrated \"wilful ignorance\" about what had been going on, which \"clearly raises questions of competence\" on his part.James Murdoch has insisted he did not know about any wrongdoing at the News of the World, but took \"his share\" of responsibility for not uncovering it earlier.He gave evidence alongside his father Rupert, who at one point during the hearing was attacked by a man who rushed forward from the public gallery and threw a paper plate of foam at him.The committee also said former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks must \"accept responsibility\" for presiding over a culture at the News of the World that led to journalists impersonating members of Milly Dowler's family and hacking the teenager's phone.And it criticised Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and former Acting Deputy Commissioner at the Metropolitan Police John Yates for failing to ensure hacking claims were properly investigated.After initially claiming malpractice was limited to one \"rogue\" reporter at the News of the World, News International has now settled dozens of civil cases admitting liability for hacking between 2001 and 2006.More than 6,000 possible victims have been identified and the police have so far made a number of arrests in connection with an investigation reopened in January 2011 -

He said he had \"absolutely no authority over Smyth\" and had felt betrayed that those in the Church who had the power to stop Smyth did not do so.In an interview with Irish radio station Newstalk on Thursday, Father D'Arcy said he would find it hard to continue if he was in the position of the current Irish Church leader.But he added that changing the cardinal would not necessarily mean a fresh start.\"The bottom line is that if Cardinal Brady goes, the ordinary  people of Ireland won't have a single vote on who replaces him. That is the problem,\" he said.\"Actually he would have to offer his resignation and if the Vatican didn't take it he would be back to square one.\"Some people think that is what happened two years ago.

Own up to your failings.\"In 1975, Cardinal Brady was a priest and teacher in County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland, when he was sent by his bishop to investigate a claim of child sexual abuse by a fellow priest.That priest was later exposed as Smyth, who died in prison in 1997, one month into a 12-year prison sentence.The first child to tell his parents about the abuse was the then 14-year-old Brendan Boland.Speaking on Wednesday, Cardinal Brady said in a            statement: \"With others, I feel betrayed that those who had the authority in the Church to stop Brendan Smyth failed to act on the evidence I gave them.\"However, I also accept that I was part of an unhelpful culture of deference and silence in society, and the Church, which thankfully is now a thing of the past.\"The cardinal said he was \"shocked, appalled and outraged\" by Smyth and said he had trusted that those with the authority to act in relation to Smyth would treat the evidence seriously and respond appropriately.\"The commentary in the programme and much of the coverage of my role in this inquiry gives the impression that I was the only person who knew of the allegations against Brendan Smyth at that time and that because of the office I hold in the Church today I somehow had the power to stop Brendan Smyth in 1975.\"I had absolutely no authority over Brendan Smyth.

TAK again claims responsibility.2016 May - Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu resigns as prime minister after falling out with President Erdogan.President Erdogan says that deal on restriction of flow of migrants into Europe - largely negotiated by Mr Davutoglu - could collapse if Turks are not granted visa-free access to the EU.2016 June - Turkey recalls its ambassador to Berlin after German parliament adopts resolution declaring as genocide the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces during WW1.A gun and suicide attack on Istanbul's Ataturk airport kills 42 people, including 13 foreign nationals. Turkish authorities believe the attack bears the hallmarks of so-called Islamic State.2016 July - The authorities detain thousands of soldiers and judges on suspicion of involvement in a coup attempt that President Erdogan says was inspired by his exiled opponent Fethullah Gulen.The government also shuts down dozens of media outlets - including 16 TV channels - during a continuing crackdown in the wake of the failed coup attempt.2016 August - President Erdogan visits St Petersburg for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two men pledge to restore the close economic ties that were badly affected after Turkey shot down a Russian bomber on the Syrian border in November 2015.The visit - President Erdogan's first trip abroad since July's failed coup - is regarded with suspicion by European leaders, who have been critical of the widespread detentions and civil liberties restrictions implemented by the Turkish authorities following the coup.\n"," A chronology of key events:\n","\n","Predicting summary for 350 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 111.67172111670176  min ---  6700.303268909454  sec ---\n","Some pupils faced transport fees of £400 a year under the proposals from the Conservative-controlled council.It has agreed to defer the cuts and take another look at the proposals.Conservative councillor Lesley Pendleton said the main aim was to cut council expenditures, but added the proposals would now be reconsidered.Councillor Pendleton, said: \"We felt it was a little too soon to make an immediate decision so we are going to have another look to make sure everything is as it should be.\"She added the council would look to see \"whether there is actually some money we can claw out from somewhere\" to pay for the transport costs.\"I have changed my tune a little but then that is democracy isn't it.

Only Miri can give us that confirmation,\" she told BBC News.JWST is a co-operative project between the US (Nasa), European (Esa) and Canadian (CSA) space agencies.Europe is providing two of the telescope's four instruments and the Ariane rocket to put it in orbit.Miri is arguably the most versatile of the four instruments, with a much wider range of detectable wavelengths than its peers (5-28 microns).Fundamentally, it is a camera system that will produce pictures of the cosmos.But it also carries a coronagraph to block the light from bright objects so it can see more easily nearby, dimmer targets - such as planets circling their stars. In addition, there is a spectrograph that will slice light into its component colours so scientists can discern something of the chemistry of far-flung phenomena.Miri is a complex design, and will operate at minus 266C. This frigid state is required for the instrument's detectors to sample the faintest of infrared sources.  Everything must be done to ensure the telescope's own heat energy does not swamp the very signal it is pursuing.The hardware for Miri has been developed by institutes and companies from across Europe and America.The job of pulling every item together and assembling the finished system has had its scientific and engineering lead in the UK.Miri has just gone through a rigorous mechanical and thermal test campaign at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire.This included shaking the instrument to simulate the pounding it will receive during the ascent to orbit on the Ariane.It was also put in a vacuum chamber and subjected to the kind of temperatures it will experience in space.\"It's been a real privilege to work on Miri and great to see it finally ship out,\" said Paul Eccleston, the engineer at RAL who has overseen the test campaign.\"It will be so exciting when we put it on top of the rocket and light the blue touch paper, so to speak, and watch it go up into space.\"The paperwork signing off the test results has now been accepted by Nasa.The next step is for Miri to be put in a special environment-controlled shipping box, so it can travel to the US space agency's Goddard centre. The Maryland facility is where the final integration of James Webb will take place.Miri will be fixed inside a cage-like structure called the Integrated Science Instrument Module and positioned just behind the big mirror.The years to 2018 promise yet more testing.Recommended 16 years ago as the logical evolution beyond Hubble, the JWST has managed to garner a fair amount of controversy.Technical difficulties and project mismanagement mean the observatory is now running years behind schedule and is billions of dollars over-budget.Elements of the US Congress wanted to cancel the telescope last summer.  That did not happen, but Capitol Hill now has James Webb on a very short leash, with Nasa required to provide monthly updates on milestones met or missed.Much of the talk around James Webb tends to centre on cost.  The current estimate for the US side is $8.8bn, which covers the full life cycle of the project from its inception to the end of initial operations.  Extra to that bill is some $650m for the European contributions like Miri and Ariane.Dr Eric Smith is Nasa's deputy programme director for James Webb.  He believes taxpayers do appreciate the venture.\"When you're able to show people that James Webb will do things that not even Hubble can do - then they understand it,\" he told BBC News.\"People recognise how iconic Hubble has been, and how much it has affected their lives.\"The images and scientific results that Hubble has returned have permeated popular culture. Webb pictures will be just as sharp but because the telescope will be looking at a different part of the spectrum, it will show us things that are totally new.\"\n"," One of Europe's main

Penrose said.The aerodrome was created in 1914 by the forerunner to the Royal Air Force.It was one of several in the south east of England used to defend London from German Zeppelin airship and bomber raids during the conflict.It ceased being used by the military in 1919 and was returned to agricultural use.Its buildings remained and, according to English Heritage, is now \"the largest known surviving group of Royal Flying Corps buildings on a WWI aerodrome\".In recent years the aerodrome was bought by private owners, who have had the buildings restored, and created a museum to tell its role during the war.In 2010, a war memorial commemorating the 10 pilots of 37 Squadron killed in action during WWI was erected on the former parade ground.Among the 24 surviving buildings are the officers' mess, accommodation huts, ammunition store, workshops, blacksmiths and mortuary.On granting the listed status, Mr Penrose said the aerodrome was a \"poignant reminder of the conditions in which they were working\".\"I am listing Stow Maries for its rarity, its architectural interest, its value as a group and also of course for its historical importance as the first line of defence

It's dying.Each year, an estimated 92,000 people in England are believed to need end of life care but not receive it.As a practising GP I have seen distressed relatives after a patient has died in hospital.Often they have not had a chance to see their relative before they died and were unaware of the seriousness of the condition, despite repeated admissions with deteriorating conditions.Many such patients are never formally identified as at risk of dying and not assessed for end of life care.One relative said something that haunts me to this day: \"I wish the doctors had told me that my mother was dying.\"As a result too many people still die in distress with uncontrolled symptoms, or have futile interventions when this will not make any difference.All of us, including doctors, must do more to talk about dying.A new ComRes research for the Dying Matters Coalition confirms there is a widespread reluctance to talk about dying and death.That is why we want to encourage people to talk more openly about dying and bereavement and to make plans around end-of-life care.Most people have not made a plan of their choices and wishes in the event of a serious illness.People often think there is plenty of time when the situation arises but often this is not the case and it can be too late.Doctors are trained to cure, but as people live with long-term conditions, the medical profession needs to change how it works with dying patients.We need to bring dying back into people's homes, rather than in hospital, care homes or hospices.As increasing numbers of people develop and live with dementia, it is vital that doctors talk about the kind of end-of-life care people would choose, while people are healthy.There's a huge change required in our culture, starting with the medical profession.Having learnt a lot from the Canadian communications expert Prof Stephen Workman, I would urge doctors to do three things.First, be compassionate but direct when talking about dying.Doctors speaking to relatives about an ill patient who is giving cause for concern, should not just say \"your husband is seriously ill\", but should add \"It is possible that he could die\". This allows all involved to prepare.Secondly, be honest and don't offer false hope.Think twice about offering a false choice of procedures like cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when someone is actually dying and chances of recovery are minuscule.Instead offer supportive care to keep the patient comfortable and allow them to die a natural dignified death.And, thirdly, when doctors diagnose a serious illness they should ask the patient whether they would like to talk about what they can expect and what is likely to happen.Most people die from frailty in old age, and will be well known to health and social care services.Importantly, this gives opportunities for talking about end of life wishes and advance care planning.My ambition is to reduce the fear of dying and increase knowledge and awareness of palliative care.It is vitally important that every person who is coming to the end of their life is spotted early enough and supported to make a good advance care plan.I know just how hard it is to address issues like this in the frenzy of busy surgeries and wards.But we as doctors need to up our game.All of us, especially doctors can play a part in ensuring everyone is able to have a good death.\n"," In this week's Scrubbing Up opinion column, Prof Mayur Lakhani chair of the Dying Matters Coalition, urges doctors to be more open and frank about preparing patients and their families for the end of life.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 358 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 113.90871789058049  min ---  6834.523075580597  sec ---\n","The assets comprise properties, money from nearly 30 bank accounts and fine art belonging to Gioacchino Campolo.Dubbed the King of Videopoker, as he made his fortune by tampering with slot machines, Campolo was sentenced last year to 18 years in prison.Authorities have described the seizure as the largest ever from a criminal in Italian history.Campolo came by his fortune by altering slot machines in countless bars and cafes.

Similarly, the massive UIDAI will vault over older technologies. \"By starting on a clean slate and reconfiguring the structure, we have opened up a whole new set of possibilities,\" says Mr Nilekani. The project will stay abreast of the latest in biometrics, cloud computing and connectivity.Costs though have been kept low, first, by adopting an open policy in selecting devices and software and encouraging multiple private vendors.Second, the project is technology-neutral, not locking in to any particular hardware or software.If the technology architecture is unique, so is its accuracy in validating identities.\"The combination of 10-finger biometrics, two-iris scans and photograph establishes the identity of a person with over 99.5% accuracy,\" says Krishnakumar Natarajan, CEO of Bangalore-based tech outsourcing firm MindTree, which is one of the firms building applications for the project.  The best of the biometric databases in the world have a single de-duplication check, to ensure that every person is identified and tagged only once.UIDAI will de-duplicate three times over, accuracy that is vital in a country which has had a massive population migration in the past decade and welfare programmes that now total $60bn in value, says Ashok Dalwai, deputy director general of UIDAI.\"A lack of identity has become the divide in India, denying needy Indians access to welfare programmes,\" Mr Dalwai says.In a country where billions of dollars in welfare get siphoned off by middlemen using fake identities, the programme will \"stem leakage and fraud\", he adds. The real challenge for the project, however, will be in the applications built around the unique identities.A slew of pilots are currently testing the robustness of the system.In a trial in Tumkur near Bangalore, Indians armed with a new unique identity number are opening bank accounts electronically.In the northern Jharkhand state, the government is electronically dispensing payments under an employment guarantee scheme directly into the recipients' bank accounts, which were opened after acquiring an identity number. In another pilot in the same region, people are authenticating themselves on a simple device connected to the network and withdrawing money from their new bank accounts.In the future, every outlet with such a device can potentially serve as a cash-dispensing \"micro ATM\".In the coming years, UIDAI holds the promise of being a game changer.With a unique identity, previously anonymous poor Indians can have access to services such as bank accounts, mobile connections and driving licences.That is already something, for a country which has a population of 1.2 billion but only 50 million passport-holders and 200 million with driving licenses.Indians design and build some of the world's most sophisticated software and technologies for multinational corporations.Now, some of this hi-tech savvy promise to transport India's neglected millions from the technological dark ages, propelling them from complete obscurity to an online identity.Saritha Rai is a journalist and commentator who tracks the economic, social and cultural changes sweeping India.\n"," In an audacious technological mission, India is building a near foolproof database of personal biometric identities for nearly a billion people, something that has never been attempted anywhere in the world.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 363 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 115.53349891901016  min ---  6932.00993680954  sec ---\n","The project will examine hair, bone and other material from a collection amassed by a Swiss biologist - and will invite submissions from elsewhere.Many cultures relate legends of hairy, humanoid creatures that lurk in the wilds, rarely seen.But material claimed to be from such creatures have never been subjected to modern scientific techniques.\"It's an area that any serious academic ventures into with a deal of trepidation... It's full of eccentric and downright misleading reports,\" said Prof Bryan Sykes, from Oxford University.The researchers will apply a systematic approach and employ the latest advances in genetic testing, aiming to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\"There have been DNA tests done on alleged yetis and other such things but since then the testing techniques, particularly on hair, have improved a lot due to advances in forensic science,\" the Oxford geneticist told Reuters news agency.Modern testing could get valid results from a fragment of a shaft of hair, added Prof Sykes, who is leading the project with Michel Sartori, director of the Lausanne Museum of Zoology.A 1951 expedition to Mount Everest famously returned with photographs of giant footprints in the snow, fuelling speculation about giant Himalayan creatures, unknown to science.Since then, many eye-witness reports of such creatures have emerged from remote regions of the world.These humanoid beasties are variously known as the \"yeti\" or \"migoi\" in the Himalayas, \"bigfoot\" or \"sasquatch\" in North America, \"almasty\" in the Caucasus mountains and \"orang pendek\" in Sumatra, but there are many others.Tests up to now have usually concluded that alleged yeti remains were in fact human. But, said Prof Sykes, \"there has been no systematic review of this material.\"The project will focus on an archive of remains held at the Lausanne museum that was assembled by Bernard Heuvelmans, a Belgian-French biologist who investigated reported yeti sightings from 1950 up to his death in 2001.Other institutions and individuals will also be asked to send in details of any possible yeti material.Aside from the yeti question, Prof Sykes said he hoped the project would add to the growing body of knowledge on the interaction between different human species in the past.\"In the last two years it has become clear that there was considerable interbreeding between            Homo sapiens and Neanderthals ... about 2% to 4% of the DNA of each individual European is Neanderthal,\" he said.Those who are favourable to the idea of as-yet undescribed creatures say the yeti and orang pendek could represent survivals of            Homo erectus,            Homo floresiensis (the Indonesian \"Hobbit\") or            Gigantopithecus - a giant ape that once inhabited the forests of East Asia. The idea has even spawned the term \"cryptozoology\" to describe the search for such beasts.Others are highly sceptical of such tales, and consider the subject unworthy of serious scientific investigation.Asked about the project's chances of success, Prof Sykes said: \"The answer is, of course, I don't know,\" adding, \"it's unlikely, but on the other hand if we don't examine it we won't know.\"\n"," A UK-Swiss team will use DNA testing to investigate the origins of remains claimed to be from yeti and bigfoot.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 364 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 115.94580997228623  min ---  6956.748600244522  sec ---\n","Cardiff-based SA Brain bought the chain Coffee #1 last year.It comes as new figures show Brains' sales are up nearly 4% in its pubs.Brains believes there is potential in the coffee market and plans a chain of about 50 outlets over the next three years in south Wales and the south west of England.The family-run brewery employs about 2,000 people.Last year's profits are up 6% against what the company described as \"a tough economic backdrop\".In autumn 2011, Brains bought Coffee #1, which comprised 15 high street shops in south Wales and the south west of England, and since then, it has opened three more.Brains chief executive Scott Waddington said: \"The research suggests that the coffee market is going to continue to grow at 5, 6, 7% for the next five years, which is pretty much what it's been doing for the last five years.\"Coffee in the UK, despite more and more places opening, still has a long way to go to catch up with more developed markets, like the US.\"Equity analyst Sam Hart said Brains' decision to diversify into coffee shops was \"probably partly a reflection of very tough conditions in the on-trade [bar and pub sales] beer market\".\"The on-trade is under pressure from a combination of pressure on consumers' disposable incomes, rising alcohol duties and the increased availability of relatively cheap beer at the supermarket chains,\" he added.Mr Hart said the growth in the coffee shop culture in the UK could be viewed as Americanisation.\"Obviously coffee has been ingrained in culture in the US for many years and this appears to be spreading to the UK and other developed markets,\" he said.\"Many people view coffee as an affordable luxury on which they are prepared to spend, despite pressures on their disposable incomes.\"\n"," Wales' largest independent brewer is planning to open about 30 coffee shops over three years as it diversifies from its traditional pub business.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 365 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 116.19014360507329  min ---  6971.408618450165  sec ---\n","Dead Men Risen, written by Toby Harnden and published by Quercus, took the prize at a ceremony in Westminster and was the judges' unanimous choice.It focuses on the death of Lt Colonel Rupert Thorneloe in 2009.It was published in amended form after the first print run was destroyed by the MoD.The judges said the book \"takes us into the hearts and minds of the Welsh Guards in a way that is both interesting and visceral\".\"It challenges every citizen of this country to examine exactly what we're asking soldiers to do in Afghanistan,\" the panel continued.\"Rather than offering easy answers it lets the soldiers speak for themselves.\"Other awards presented included a posthumous honour for Christopher Hitchens, whose final book, Arguably, was included on the long list for the top prize.Hitchens' widow Carol Blue accepted the award on behalf of the Vanity Fair writer.The journalism prize was awarded to Amelia Gentleman for her work in The Guardian, while the blog award went to Rangers Tax Case - an online commentary on the ongoing financial problems at the historic Scottish football club.The writers of the blog said they aimed to \"provide the details of what Rangers FC have done, why it was illegal and what the implications are for one of the largest football clubs in Britain\".The winners were chosen from shortlists of six books, six journalists and seven bloggers, whittled down from longlists of 17 books, 12 journalists and 18 bloggers.Each of the winners received a Â£3,000 prize.\n"," A book about the death of a British officer in Afghanistan, once pulped by the Ministry of Defence, has won the Orwell Prize for political writing.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 366 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 116.40232527256012  min ---  6984.139518499374  sec ---\n","Kirklees Council had been consulting on plans to replace paid staff at seven sites in Huddersfield with volunteers.Protesters who gathered outside a council meeting on Wednesday said a survey had showed 66% of people were opposed to the plan.The council later said there would be no changes for three years.

patient. It will take up to four months for her to be paid.Cashback sites are a simple idea. Instead of going directly to a shop, you access a retailer's online store through a link from a cashback website.You still receive your item directly from the retailer, but you also get some money from the cashback website.It is often a percentage of the total price you paid.The sites have links to retailers of everything from groceries and toiletries, to insurance policies and broadband deals.But Ms Sen has not actually had any money back yet.\"I thought it was going to be as easy as one-two-three, just make the purchase to the website and get the cash back the next day,\" she said.\"But that didn't happen. It's been well over a month and I'm still waiting for it.\"Ms Sen thinks the website is not clear enough about how long that wait will be.\"I have no idea how long it's going to take me to get the cash back,\" she said.She went through one of the biggest cashback sites, Quidco.It says it has more than 2 million members in the UK, and that the average user can make £262 a year.That is small change for its more committed users. Quidco says more than a hundred of them have made over £10,000.But, like all cashback websites, its customers can face long waits for their money to start coming in.Andy Oldham is the company's managing director and said every attempt is made to be clear and transparent.\"That's the whole ethos of the site,\" he said.\"On every single merchant page, we've got statistics that show the time it takes for those transactions to be paid out.\"For example, with the bike Ms Sen bought, the information about the length of time is displayed underneath the deal.We pointed this out to Ms Sen, who said she had never noticed the warning before.She thinks that four months is too long to wait for her money.\"It's right down the bottom of the page,\" she said.\"Look how light the shade of the font is. It's just not prominent enough. They need to make it clearer,\" she added.Despite all this, she says she will carry on using cashback websites.\"My attitude is, it's better than getting no money back at all,\" she said.Quidco's Andy Oldham said he would take Ms Sen's feedback on board.He admitted there was \"quite possibly\" an argument for rethinking how this information is shown on the website.Mr Oldham maintains that it is impossible to give an average waiting time, because it depends on different retailers and products.So, if you are buying something like food, that will be consumed quickly, you should be paid relatively quickly.On the other hand, if you book a holiday six months in advance, you will not be paid until after you come home.Mr Oldham says it was important that customers realised that cashback arrangements do not pay out immediately.\"We're very much dependent on the retailer paying us the advertising commission before we pay it back to the consumer,\" he pointed out.Another site, TopCashBack, says it works hard to manage consumers' expectations about how long it takes to get their money.But on average, those customers may have to wait 12 weeks for their money to clear into their accounts.There are other things to be aware of if you sign up to a cashback website.Some, like Quidco, charge an annual fee while others take a cut out of your commission.Personal finance expert Sarah Pennells, from the website Savvywoman, says there are dozens of sites to pick from, so it is important to shop around to find the best one for you.\"The first thing is to look at how much cash you're going to get back on the various deals and secondly, look at how they're going to pay you,\" she said.\"Some pay by cheque, others by bank transfer, some ask you to set up a PayPal account.\"The last thing, and possibly most important thing, is don't just focus on the cashback deal.

Patients are beginning to see the signs of a service in distress.\"He said A&E waiting times over winter, reports of patients on trolleys in corridors, redundancies, and \"reports of services being restricted\" were \"leading people to feel worried about the future of the NHS\".And Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, added: \"These results give us a sharp indication that the public have become worried and confused about what is going on with the NHS.\"But Health Minister Simon Burns said the findings contradicted the government's own research which showed satisfaction rates remained high.In particular, he highlighted the annual patient survey which showed that 92% of patients said their experience was good, very good or excellent.\"The British Social Attitudes Survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the NHS, so responses are influenced by other factors.\"By its nature it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients.\"\n"," Public satisfaction with the NHS has dropped by a record amount, the British Social Attitudes Survey suggests.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 387 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 122.47977289756139  min ---  7348.786390542984  sec ---\n","Police briefly detained the protesters.The envoy was questioned on Friday after his Indian wife alleged he sexually abused their three-year-old.Although a case has been registered against him, he has not been arrested or formally charged.

Some report banks are still unwilling to lend to business. Others say businesses are unwilling to take on new debt and are paying back loans. Either way, repayments are rising faster than borrowing, leaving the latest \"net\" lending figure (for the first quarter of 2014) down.So what are the mechanics of FLS?Banks and other lenders approach the Bank of England, if they want. They swap assets they already have, such as loans, with the Bank. It in turn provides them with pieces of paper known as Treasury bills, for a four-year period.The commercial banks are then able to use these bits of paper as top quality backing with which to borrow cash in the wholesale financial markets, from other lenders. With the Treasury's backing, the idea is that they will be able to borrow funds at very cheap rates.How will the taxpayer be protected in this arrangement?The collateral pledged by commercial banks will have to be worth more than the high-grade paper being offered by the Bank of England.  So, for every £1 of Treasury bills they borrow, the assets being pledged will have to be worth, say, £1.10 or £1.20. Thus if the value of that asset subsequently falls, the Bank of England will not suffer from the top slice of any loss.What about savers?They have suffered an unforeseen knock-on effect of FLS. The availability of cheap funds from the Bank means that lenders do not need to try so hard to attract funds from the general public, to then lend on to borrowers. That is why it is now almost impossible to find a savings account offering more than 3% interest.\n"," Funding for Lending (FLS), the Bank of England and Treasury scheme, initially to boost bank lending to households and companies, opened for business at the beginning of August 2012.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 389 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 122.95159873962402  min ---  7377.095926523209  sec ---\n","Jimmy Carlson, 64, from Islington, north London, has been appointed OBE for helping to improve services.The former alcoholic became homeless after he was discharged from the Army.Doctor Daniel Moynihan, who runs 13 academies across London, has been knighted, while Emma Colyer has been appointed MBE for charity work.Mr Carlson served with the Royal Pioneer Corps (RPC) - which later became part of the Royal Logistic Corps - for five years.When he was discharged in 1973, he became an alcoholic and lived rough on the streets and in hostels until 1996 when he stopped drinking.Since then he has worked with Groundswell, a self-help organisation for the homeless, and has also helped to bring homeless people together with government ministers.Mr Carlson has also raised £100,000 for The Haven, a club where people in recovery from substance misuse can meet in an alcohol and drug-free environment.He said he was humbled to receive the honour.\"I have been to the very bottom and never would have imagined this day then.\"Lots of people have helped me on the way and I can only hope that my story can inspire others - the same way I have been helped.\"He added: \"My message is, 'never give up on anyone'.

He will say to Europe that he has anchored Greece in the eurozone and wants something in return. That will be difficult.Already German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has come out and said that the substance of the Greek reform bailout programme is non-negotiable. Where there might be some flexibility is over the timing of the implementation of reforms. There may also be some movement over interest rates on the loans and the EU might offer Greece some funds to boost growth.But the message is clear; the austerity programme with its budget and spending cuts will stay.  The German finance minister underlined that message when he said: \"Greece's path will be neither short nor easy\".He is now meeting President Carolos Papoulias, who is expected to give him the mandate to try to form a government.Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipras said his party would not take part in the government, and would instead become a powerful anti-austerity voice in the opposition.The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Athens, says Mr Samaras is expected to try for a broad coalition, hoping to create a stable government with a stronger popular mandate.He says Mr Samaras will push for a lightening of the bailout terms from Brussels, arguing that Greeks have accepted more pain by electing a pro-bailout party and that Europe should now cut Greece some slack.However, correspondents also point out that only 40% of voters backed parties that broadly support the bail-out deal with the EU and the IMF.Tough austerity measures were attached to the two international bailouts awarded to Greece, an initial package worth 110bn euros (Â£89bn; $138bn) in 2010, then a follow-up last year worth 130bn euros.Sunday's vote was watched around the world, amid fears that a Greek exit from the euro could spread contagion to other eurozone members and deepen the turmoil in the global economy.European stock markets were mixed in morning trading.

Greece's place in Europe will not be put in doubt,\" promising that Athens would \"honour its obligations\".Our correspondent, Mark Lowen, says this suggests that Mr Samaras wants to press ahead with spending cuts demanded by the country's international creditors.European leaders have warned that if the new Greek government rejects the bailout, the country could be forced to abandon the single currency.New Democracy should be able to build a majority coalition with the socialist Pasok.However, coalition talks may not be easy.In addition to Syriza's showing, four other parties which oppose or want a radical overhaul of the bailout look set to take between 60 and 70 seats. They include the far-right Golden Dawn, which has about 7% of the vote.The leader of Pasok, Evangelos Venizelos, proposed a broad four-party coalition including New Democracy, Pasok, the Democratic Left and Syriza.\"No decision can be taken without this national unity,\" he said.\n"," World leaders have welcomed the narrow election victory of Greece's broadly pro-bailout New Democracy party and urged Athens to form a cabinet quickly.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 392 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 124.03422768115998  min ---  7442.053663015366  sec ---\n","He's been disqualified in the final at Queen's Club for kicking out at an advertising panel.But it wasn't just the panel that felt his frustration -

and if this stays intact, the scientists conclude, gas leakage should not be a problem.They also say that with good management of waste water, chemical contamination should be avoided; they criticise the US practice of leaving it in open ponds, which would not be permitted in the UK.The report says the risk that fracking will generate significant seismic events is also small.The actual explosions are far too small to be noticed at the surface, said Prof Zoe Shipton from the University of Strathclyde.\"If the fluid moves into existing faults in the rock that are close to slipping anyway, you'll bring that slippage forward in time,\" she said.\"But the Magnitude 2.3 event in Blackpool last year - that is like a lorry going past your house - in fact the British Geological Survey can't measure below Magnitude 2 in towns because of the traffic.\"The European industry is in its infancy compared with the US, and governments' views on the technology are mixed.Fracking has been banned in France, but countries such as Poland are taking a strong interest.UK ministers see shale gas as a way of cheaply bridging the transition to a low-carbon fuel mix, despite calculations showing that widespread adoption without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology would mean future UK governments missing their legally-binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.Prof Mair said climate impacts were outside his remit, but a detailed look at the issue should happen at some stage.\"The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed,\" he said.\"It's a very wide issue - energy policy, CO2 reduction, all of that needs to be looked at - and gas in general is part of that.\"Follow Richard            on Twitter\n"," A gas extraction method which triggered two earth tremors near Blackpool last year should not cause earthquakes or contaminate water but rules governing it will need tightening, experts say.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 398 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 125.37312454779943  min ---  7522.38747549057  sec ---\n","Mr Anderson was diagnosed 18 months ago but has spoken about it publicly for the first time for an Alzheimer's Society walk launch on Thursday.The 83-year-old, who lives in Henley-on-Thames, said of living with the condition: \"I've lost my freedom.\"Thunderbirds was filmed on Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire and was first broadcast in 1965.Speaking on BBC Berkshire he said: \"I don't think I realised at all.

And Japan had as big a proportion of young graduates as India.Now China and India are the biggest players.Their rise in graduate numbers reflects their changing ambitions - wanting to compete against advanced economies for high-skill, high-income employment.Instead of offering low-cost manufacture, they are targeting the hi-tech professional jobs that have become the preserve of the Westernised middle classes.As the OECD figures show, this is not simply a case of countries such as China expanding while others stand still.Across the industrialised world, graduate numbers are increasing - just not as quickly as China, where they have risen fivefold in a decade.The OECD notes that by 2020, China's young graduate population will be about the same as the total US population between the ages of 25 and 64.This changing world map will see Brazil having a bigger share of graduates than Germany, Turkey more than Spain, Indonesia three times more than France.The UK is bucking the trend, projected to increase its share from 3% in 2010 to 4% in 2020.This push for more graduates has a clear economic purpose, says the OECD's analysis.Shifting from \"mass production to knowledge economy occupations\" means improved employment rates and earnings - so there are \"strong incentives\" for countries to expand higher education.But will there be enough graduate jobs to go round?The OECD has tried to analyse this by looking at one aspect of the jobs market - science and technology-related occupations.These jobs have grown rapidly - and the report suggests it is an example of how expanding higher education can generate new types of employment.These science and technology jobs - for professionals and technicians - account for about four in every 10 jobs in some Scandinavian and northern European countries, the OECD suggests.In contrast - and showing more of the old order - these technology jobs are only a small fraction of the workforce in China and India.The OECD concludes that there are substantial economic benefits from investing in higher education - creating new jobs for the better-educated as unskilled manufacturing jobs disappear.The OECD forecast reveals the pace of growth in graduate numbers. But it does not show the quality or how this expansion will translate into economic impact.There are other ways of mapping the changing distribution of knowledge.A team at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute has produced a set of maps showing the \"geography of the world's knowledge\".This measures how populations are consuming and producing information in the online world - mapping the level of internet use, the amount of user-generated material in Google, concentrations of academic activity and the geographical focus of Wikipedia articles.And in contrast to the rise of the Asian economies, this tells a story of continuing Western cultural dominance.\"In raw numbers of undergraduates and PhDs, the Asian economies are racing ahead,\" says Prof Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, from the Oxford Internet Institute.\"But what's interesting is how the West persists in its positions of strength - because the West controls the institutions.\"There are more students in China than ever before - but they still use Western mechanisms to publish results, they accept the filters,\" says Prof Mayer-Schonberger.\"The big question will be whether the Chinese researchers can be as insightful as their Western counterparts - we don't know yet.\"The maps also reveal how much Africa and South America are losing out in this new scramble for digital power.Prof Mayer-Schonberger said he was \"completely shocked\" at the extent of the imbalance.Another feature of the Oxford study is to show how research bases and their spin-out economic activity are clustered into relatively small areas.In the US, says Prof Mayer-Schonberger, there is hugely disproportionate investment around Silicon Valley and the Boston area, with large tracts of \"wasteland\" between.\"Each era has its own distinct geography. In the information age, it's not dependent on roads or waterways, but on bases of knowledge.\"This is a new kind of industrial map.

Although triggered by these cataclysmic events, the subsequent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant cannot be regarded as a natural disaster. It was a profoundly manmade disaster - that could and should have been foreseen and prevented...Our report catalogues a multitude of errors and wilful negligence that left the Fukushima plant unprepared for the events of March 11. And it examines serious deficiencies in the response to the accident by Tepco, regulators and the government.For all the extensive detail it provides, what this report cannot fully convey - especially to a global audience - is the mindset that supported the negligence behind this disaster. What must be admitted - very painfully - is that this was a disaster \"Made in Japan.\"Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the program'; our groupism; and our insularity.(Chairman Kiyoshi Kurokawa)Collusion and lack of governanceThe Tepco Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and [private plant operator] Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties. They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly \"manmade\"...We believe that the root causes were the organizational and regulatory systems... rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual.[All parties] failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements - such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release.Organisational problems within TepcoHad there been a higher level of knowledge, training, and equipment inspection related to severe accidents, and had there been specific instructions given to the on-site workers concerning the state of emergency within the necessary time frame, a more effective accident response would have been possible... Sections in the diagrams of the severe accident instruction manual were missing.Emergency response issuesThe government, the regulators, Tepco management, and the Kantei [prime minister's office] lacked the preparation and the mindset to efficiently operate an emergency response to an accident of this scope. None, therefore, were effective in preventing or limiting the consequential damage.In the critical period just after the accident, the Kantei did not promptly declare a state of emergency. The regional nuclear emergency response team was meant to be the contact between the Kantei and the operator, responsible for keeping the Kantei informed about the situation on the ground. Instead, the Kantei contacted Tepco headquarters and the Fukushima site directly, and disrupted the planned chain of command.Evacuation issuesThe Commission concludes that the residents' confusion over the evacuation stemmed from the regulators' negligence and failure over the years to implement adequate measures against a nuclear disaster, as well as a lack of action by previous governments and regulators focused on crisis management. The crisis management system that existed for the Kantei and the regulators should protect the health and safety of the public, but it failed in this function.The central government... failed to convey the severity of the accident... [O]nly 20% of the residents of the town hosting the plant knew about the accident when evacuation from the 3km zone was ordered at 21:23 on the evening of March 11.There was great confusion over the evacuation, caused by prolonged shelter-in-place orders and voluntary evacuation orders. Some residents were evacuated to high dosage areas because radiation monitoring information was not provided.Continuing public health and welfare issues[R]esidents in the affected area are still struggling from the effects of the accident. They continue to face grave concerns, including the health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment. ...The Commission concludes that the government and the regulators are not fully committed to protecting public health and safety; that they have not acted to protect the health of the residents and to restore their welfare.Approximately 150,000 people were evacuated in response to the accident... Insufficient evacuation planning led to many residents receiving unnecessary radiation exposure. Others were forced to move multiple times, resulting in increased stress and health risks - including deaths among seriously ill patients.\"If there had been even a word about a nuclear power plant when the evacuation was ordered, we could have reacted reasonably, taken our valuables with us or locked up the house before we had left. We had to run with nothing but the clothes we were wearing. It is such a disappointment every time we are briefly allowed to return home only to find out that we have been robbed again.\" (Comment by a resident of Okuma, from report appendices)Regulator failuresThe regulators did not monitor or supervise nuclear safety... They avoided their direct responsibilities by letting operators apply regulations on a voluntary basis. Their independence from the political arena, the ministries promoting nuclear energy, and the operators was a mockery. They were incapable, and lacked the expertise and the commitment to assure the safety of nuclear power.Operator failuresTepco did not fulfil its responsibilities as a private corporation, instead obeying and relying upon the government bureaucracy of Meti, the government agency driving nuclear policy. At the same time... it manipulated the cosy relationship with the regulators to take the teeth out of regulations.Shortcomings in laws and regulationsLaws and regulations related to nuclear energy have only been revised as stopgap measures, based on actual accidents. They have not been seriously and comprehensively reviewed in line with the accident response and safeguarding measures of an international standard. As a result, predictable risks have not been addressed.The existing regulations primarily are biased toward the promotion of a nuclear energy policy, and not to public safety, health and welfare. The unambiguous responsibility that operators should bear for a nuclear disaster was not specified. There was also no clear guidance about the responsibilities of the related parties in the case of an emergency.No 'cosmetic solutions'Replacing people or changing the names of institutions will not solve the problems. Unless these root causes are resolved, preventive measures against future similar accidents will never be complete...The underlying issue is the social structure that results in \"regulatory capture,\" and the organisational, institutional, and legal framework that allows individuals to justify their own actions, hide them when inconvenient, and leave no records in order to avoid responsibility.\n"," A Japanese parliamentary panel has delivered a damning verdict after investigating the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant which followed an earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 407 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 127.92165145079295  min ---  7675.2990889549255  sec ---\n","A police source told BBC Radio WM a passenger was seen pouring a liquid into a box, which then started smoking.The 48 passengers on the Megabus Preston to London service were led off the coach and forced to sit apart in a cordon on the opposite carriageway.Police said a report of vapour escaping from a bag which led to the security alert was caused by \"a health improvement aid for smokers\".The motorway was closed between junctions T3 and T4 near Lichfield before police said they were no longer treating the incident as suspicious, but it has now reopened.Staffordshire Police said the coach stopped on the hard shoulder \"of its own accord\" at 08:20 BST.About four hours after armed officers arrived, police confirmed the scene as safe.

The meeting was described by officials as good and candid but this is still a tentative relationship, not a full embrace.The US administration is slowly feeling its way in the region, learning to work with groups that Washington has shunned in the past.When Condoleezza Rice was here in 2005 as US Secretary of State, she was categorical - the US would not engage with the Muslim Brotherhood. But in the new Arab world, long-held American assumptions about who is a friend or not have been shattered. And new problems have emerged.Outside Mrs Clinton's hotel, dozens of Egyptians protested against Mr Mursi and continued US military aid to Egypt under his presidency with slogans like: \"We don't want Hamas to rule Egypt.\"Afterwards, Mrs Clinton told reporters: \"I have come to Cairo to reaffirm the strong support of the United States for the Egyptian people and their democratic transition.\"We want to be a good partner and we want to support the democracy that has been achieved by the courage and sacrifice of the Egyptian people.\"The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says that for all the US fears of an Islamist takeover in recent decades, the governments in Washington and Egypt have now realised they need each other.Mr Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood are particularly keen to avoid the sort of international isolation that has been so damaging to other Islamist governments after they have taken office, our correspondent adds.Saturday's talks launched a series of high-level meetings aimed at stabilising Egypt's fledgling democracy and its alliance with the US.Mr Mursi has tried to defuse a row over parliament - a body he tried to reinstate by decree last weekend.The chamber, dominated by Mr Mursi's Islamist allies, was shut down by the military before he took power. The Supreme Constitutional Court has said the dissolution is final.Mr Mursi says he is \"committed to the rulings of Egyptian judges and very keen to manage state powers and prevent any confrontation\".Mrs Clinton said she would meet the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, on Sunday.He became the country's interim ruler after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in February last year.Mrs Clinton praised the role played by the military, but said she would make clear to Field Marshal Tantawi that the US supports the return of the armed forced \"to a purely military role\".The secretary of state also encouraged President Mursi to live up to his promises to protect the rights of women and minorities, and to preserve the peace treaty with Israel.Mrs Clinton arrived in Egypt from a week-long trip to Asia, and will later visit Israel.\n"," US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has voiced support for a \"full transition to civilian rule\" in Egypt, at the start of a visit to Cairo.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 413 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 129.8623118599256  min ---  7791.738713264465  sec ---\n","The choice of a running mate is one of the most crucial decisions a candidate will make during a presidential run.He is looking for a number two who can balance his weaknesses, appeal to new voter constituencies, persuade independent voters to give him a second look, and campaign effectively on his behalf.All the while, Mr Romney will need a partner who will not outshine him on the stump or otherwise detract attention from him.The perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes.As Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities:Paul Ryan, 42, has made a name for himself as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes.The Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit.He is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election.Since becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget.But Mr Ryan's budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that they could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes.Mr Ryan studied at Ohio's Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. He is currently serving his seventh term.Rob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush.In selecting him, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket.But Mr Portman's strengths are also his weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, he brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. His years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney's effort to run as a political outsider. And his role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard-core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush's expansion of government spending and his widening of the federal budget deficit.Mr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr's White House. He served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed him US Trade Representative.In 2006, Mr Bush appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. He left that job in 2007.In 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich.Tim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a \"Sam's Club Republican\" for his supposed appeal to working and lower-middle class voters (Sam's Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal-Mart).Mr Pawlenty made his own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when he failed to gain traction with voters or the media.He could help balance Mr Romney's wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full-time job, he has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally.But he is seen as lacking charisma, and he does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before that, in 1956.Mr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy (although he later renounced his backing for \"cap and trade\" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children.Mr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. He studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992.He rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, he was elected governor. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008.Marco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: He is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. He is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving him a grassroots appeal Mr Romney's other options lack.The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama's overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And he could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket.But Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, he is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and he has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when he launched his run for the White House.When Mr Rubio was young, his family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney's Mormon faith.And it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language.Mr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 he was elected to the US Senate.Bobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing him, Mr Romney would hope to broaden his appeal beyond non-Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party's image among independent voters.Mr Jindal is a die-hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors' charge against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right-wing.Mr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar.Mr Jindal's first foray into national politics fell flat - he was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - and he was dismissed as not quite ready for prime-time.His national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when he positioned himself as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration's response.Before entering politics, he worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC.While in his mid-20s he was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Under President George W Bush, he was assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.Mr Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, and became governor in 2008.John Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant-killer by fellow Republicans since he ousted the Senate's Democratic majority leader to claim his seat in the chamber in 2004.The two-term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from his own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates.Mr Thune's staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince his party's base that he is conservative enough for them.In 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president himself but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that he preferred to serve in the \"trenches\" of the Senate.Mr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. He studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota's business school.He served in the House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003.\n"," US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is expected to name his vice-presidential running mate soon - possibly within days.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 414 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 130.22906740903855  min ---  7813.744046449661  sec ---\n","Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects around 120 families in Wales but the only UK centres are in England.Charity Action Duchenne said a new facility could improve the quality of life and lifespan of sufferers.The Welsh government has said it is working to improve services and support for those with muscular dystrophy.Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most severe of the muscular dystrophies, according to the Action Duchenne charity.The charity said the disease, which affects mainly boys, was 100% fatal.Sufferers are diagnosed usually by the age of five and without good medical intervention they rarely live beyond their late teens and twenties, it said.Wales was the only country in the UK to screen newborn children for the condition, but screening was withdrawn at the end of November.The Welsh government said the test was no longer reliable.Around 100 parents and campaigners gathering at the Welsh assembly on Tuesday are also seeking matched funding to support new research that could deliver a cure for the disease in the next few years.Nick Catlin, of Action Duchenne, said advances in medicine made a longer lifespan and improved quality of life for all young men living with Duchenne \"a real possibility\".\"It is a critical time to invest in research for treatments that will see the condition stabilised to enable our young people to live longer,\" said Mr Catlin.He added: \"Without further funding and government support we cannot achieve our goal of providing personalised care and support into adulthood to improve the quality of life for those living with Duchenne.\"John Burke, who lives in Cardiff and whose three-year-old son, Seth, has the disease, is among those taking part in a lobby at the Welsh assembly.He told BBC Radio Wales that from the outside Seth looked just like a normal, happy, healthy little boy.But he added: \"Unfortunately for me and his mum it's just a waiting and watching game.\"It's a progressive illness.

Production is now halted and the gate is being guarded by policemen.India's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki was one of the first car companies to set up here. Many ancillary units followed them. Now Haryana is considered one of the foremost car-making hubs in India.But labour issues have long been a concern here. Companies have been asking for India's old labour laws to be reformed for some time now.There has been a lot of speculation about what triggered these protests, but most observers believe it is linked to a disagreement over wages and employee contracts.Most industries get around the strict labour laws by employing more contract labourers or outsourcing to an agency.Managers and workers blame each other for starting the clashes, which follow months of troubled labour relations.The violence at the vast factory in Haryana state is believed to have erupted after an altercation between a factory worker and a supervisor.Workers reportedly ransacked offices and set fires at the height of the violence. It escalated when they tried to take disciplinary action against the employee as other workers protested and blocked all exit gates, preventing senior executives and managers from leaving the factory.The union denied responsibility for the violence and told local media that it was triggered by \"objectionable remarks\" made by the supervisorDozens of staff, both management and shop-floor workers, were taken to a nearby hospital.Maruti company officials have also told the BBC that more than 50 senior manager level staff are still in hospital.

With almost every other nation in the race desperate to avoid a sprint, Team GB were always going to struggle to keep the 144-strong field together.Media playback is not supported on this deviceA pattern was set from start of the race when, after the riders had avoided an errant dog, 12 men from as many countries jumped clear to form the first breakaway.Among this group were dangerous riders such as Australian veteran Stuart O'Grady, Slovenian star Janez Brajkovic and versatile Dutchman Lieuwe Westra - and they soon built their lead to six minutes.But with half the 250km distance completed, Team GB seemed comfortable at the front of the chasing group.It was at this point that the nature of the race changed ever so subtly, but ever so significantly.First, Italy's Vincenzo Nibali broke away, dragging two Belgians and a Dutchman with him. The threat to Cavendish did not seem obvious, because the time gaps looked manageable, but the danger grew  as more riders infiltrated this group.With the final lap of Box Hill completed, Cavendish looked fresh. A fast and flat 30-mile dash back to London lay ahead of him and expectation of a first British gold medal at London 2012 grew.But the lead group was now 30-strong, the original dozen and Nibali's chasers, and when Belgian one-day specialist Philippe Gilbert sprang clear, panic set in.Gilbert had gone too early, but Fabian Cancellara, a silver medallist in this event from Beijing, was far too strong a rider to be two minutes clear with 20 miles to go.But the Swiss star made a critical mistake on a corner coming out of Richmond Park and his race was done. By this stage, so was Froome's and it suddenly became clear that there would be no grandstand finish for Cavendish and Team GB.The remaining leaders now started to eye each other and it was Vinokourov, who completed a two-year drugs ban in 2009, and Uran who grabbed the initiative with a smart burst through Putney.The last five minutes of the race were an anti-climax for most of the spectators but a masterclass in racing from \"Vino\".Uran, a team-mate of Cavendish at Sky, was completely outfoxed by the Kazakh in the sprint and had to settle for silver.\n"," Mark Cavendish's Olympic gold medal bid ended in disappointment as Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan won the men's road race.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 419 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 131.70368908643724  min ---  7902.221347093582  sec ---\n","Media playback is not supported on this deviceOribe Peralta struck from the 18-yard box after 32 seconds following some poor Brazilian defending.Fabian Marco hit the Brazil crossbar before a completely unmarked Peralta headed his team's second goal.Brazil, also hoping to win gold for the first time, pulled a goal back through Hulk in injury-time, before Oscar headed wide when well positioned.\"No one predicted that.

They just thought they could turn up and win. It was a shocking performance from Brazil.

There was to be no reprieve with 15 minutes remaining.A free-kick was delivered from the right and the Mexico striker was left completely alone to head home from eight yards.Brazil's frustrating afternoon saw team-mates Juan Jesus and Rafael square up to each other in the final minutes.Hulk's injury-time strike into the bottom corner briefly ignited hope of a spectacular comeback and Oscar then headed wastefully wide at the near post as Mexico held on.\n"," Mexico stunned favourites Brazil 2-1 at Wembley to win the men's Olympic football gold medal for the first time.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 420 / 11333 \n","--- time --- 131.97928552627565  min ---  7918.757133483887  sec ---\n","Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe team finished second but the final handover between Daniel Talbot and Adam Gemili, 18, was not completed in time.Gemili said: \"Maybe I went early or too hard.

I'm very, very excited.\"Meanwhile, a BBC investigation has found illegal websites still offering tickets - which they have no right to sell - and which buyers may never receive.Police have warned that such sites do not have access to tickets.Det Supt Nick Downing, the head of the Olympic crime squad, said: \"If they're an authorised site selling tickets, you've got to ask the question - where did they get their tickets from? How can they guarantee a supply? They can't.\"In other developments:Briton Chris Froome took the bronze medal in the time trial, which was watched along the route by an estimated 300,000 people.Wiggins's grandmother Maureen Cousins was also at the side of the road as he crossed the finish line.\"I screamed when he won.  It is a combination of delight and relief... We all think he is the greatest,\" she said.Earlier, Glover and Stanning made history by becoming the first British women to win an Olympic gold medal for rowing.Mr Johnson said an \"historic triumph will be celebrated throughout the country today\".\"It's an outstanding achievement and I'm sure it will spur on all our athletes in the medal stakes. It's fantastic - Go Team GB,\" he added.Glover, 26, a former PE teacher from Penzance, Cornwall, had been rowing for only four years before securing gold with Stanning, 27, a Royal Artillery captain, from Lossiemouth, Moray.They stormed home in front of cheering crowds at Eton Dorney after leading from the start of the women's pair race.After crossing the line they hugged each other and saluted the crowd, which included Princes William and Harry and the Princess Royal.Speaking at the finish line, Glover's mother Rachel said her family was \"absolutely delighted\".Stanning is likely to be deployed to Afghanistan next year.Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Palmer, said: \"Soldiers from 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery were thrilled to watch the race from their bases in Afghanistan, while their friends and families watched it here in the UK.\"I am sure that they have been inspired by her performance and we look forward to welcoming her back to the regiment later this year.\"Lt Col Palmer spoke to Stanning on the BBC News Channel, telling her she had \"done a very special thing\".\"We're looking forward to a very big party when you do come back to the regiment,\" he told Stanning.Labour leader Ed Miliband praised the athletes as \"fantastic\" and said the games were going \"beyond\" expectations.\n"," Praise has poured in for cyclist Bradley Wiggins and rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning after they scooped Britain's first gold medals of 2012.\n","\n","Predicting summary for 430 / 11333 \n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
